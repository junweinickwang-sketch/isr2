            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                In recent times, legislators across the globe have both proposed and enacted laws that prohibit the use of mobile phones within schools. A significant quantitative assessment by Beland and Murphy (2016) indicates that such a policy is highly cost-effective and successful in enhancing student academic achievement. Specifically, the study proposes that students with the lowest academic performance stand to benefit the most from this ban. By employing a comparable empirical framework with data sourced from Sweden, our research partially reproduces their study, which contributes external validation to this policy issue. Additionally, our study achieves a higher survey participation rate from schools, reaching about 75 percent, even though this meant gathering less detailed information in the survey. Our findings in the Swedish context show that mobile phone prohibitions have no discernible effect on student academic outcomes, allowing us to dismiss the possibility of even minor improvements.

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The field of education has been significantly altered by technological advancements. Expenditure on information and communication technology (ICT) has become substantial, yet it offers the potential for considerable improvements in education and learning processes. Nevertheless, the swift rise in ICT adoption presents a drawback, as it can potentially divert student attention and impede their learning. Moreover, a consensus has not been reached among researchers regarding which technologies are effective and under what circumstances, a topic explored by Escueta, Quan, Nickow, and Oreopoulos (2017). It is, therefore, not unexpected that various nations are initiating measures to restrict and manage the use of ICT in educational settings. For instance, as of 2018, students in French secondary schools are forbidden from using their phones throughout the school day. This ban was enacted through new legislation concerning mobile phones. A comparable policy debate is underway in Denmark and Britain, proceeding from the premise that mobile phones serve as a distraction to students and obstruct learning. The same justification underlies the recent proposals by the Swedish prime minister and education minister to establish an identical type of prohibition. In every instance, supporters of the ban cite the noteworthy study on mobile phone bans in Great Britain conducted by Beland and Murphy (2016), hereafter referred to as B&M. Their research posits that a ban represents an extremely low-cost yet potent policy for elevating student performance. The study particularly highlights that the students achieving at the lowest levels have the most significant potential for improvement. Considering the policy's minimal cost, it is understandable why governments of both left and right political leanings have been keen to propose and enforce bans on mobile phones.

            <p>
                While few other studies causally assess mobile phone bans, several well-structured experimental studies examine the effects of ICT access, and conversely, ICT prohibition, at the K-12 level, as reviewed in Escueta et al. (2017). The strategy of providing one computer for each student (known as 1-to-1) has been shown to be inadequate for achieving learning improvements. The general finding from the K-12 educational level indicates that providing a child with a computer might have restricted effects on learning results (as seen in Fairlie & Robinson, 2013, and Fairlie & Kalil, 2017), though it could enhance computer literacy and other cognitive skills, according to Malamud and Pop‐Eleches (2011).

                However, in the specific evaluation of mobile phone prohibitions, the B&M study is the only large-scale quantitative assessment of which we are aware. Although their research is original, creative, and meticulously conducted, it requires an accumulation of scientific evidence through replication in both comparable environments and in other nations with varied contexts before it can be adopted as universal policy guidance. Because the B&M study has garnered considerable notice from policymakers outside of Great Britain, especially in Scandinavian nations, we were motivated to conduct a replication using Swedish data. Since we also aimed to enhance the response rate seen in the B&M survey, our focus is on the primary analysis of their research, which is whether a school-level ban on mobile phone use elevates learning outcomes. Consequently, we are unable to fully replicate the depth of B&M's work, as they conducted much more detailed surveys, analyzing factors such as compliance rates and other key variables. They also detail the strictness of the ban, defining effective bans as those where use is forbidden on school property. The outcomes of such restrictions could differ from absolute bans as defined in our study. This represents a distinction, but we opted to prioritize a higher response rate over collecting extensive details, though we recognize this could account for the variation between the studies. By maintaining a straightforward survey, we attained a response rate of roughly 75%, in contrast to the 21% in B&M's study. A further significant contrast between the studies is that the data in B&M's research spans from 2001 to 2013. The evolution of digital technologies is swift, and since 2013, both mobile phones and computers have grown more sophisticated and their use more common.

                Our results indicate that prohibitions on mobile phones do not affect student performance, and we are able to rule out even minimal positive effects of such bans in the Swedish context. Based on the findings of this research, our policy recommendation is that although enacting a mobile phone ban is an attractive option due to its low cost, it should not be anticipated to yield significant improvements in student performance. Therefore, this research serves as a valuable supplement to B&M's work and offers policy direction for politicians beyond Britain. We propose that there are at least two potential reasons for the differing results, aside from the methodological variations previously mentioned. Firstly, it is possible that teachers are already enforcing mobile phone bans within their classrooms in practice, irrespective of the official school policy. Secondly, as Ott (2017) has documented, while teachers in upper secondary schools might not view mobile phones as generally beneficial during classes, they may still authorize their use for specific, schoolwork-related tasks. Furthermore, Swedish schools have a long-standing tradition of making significant investments in digital technologies and devices like laptops and tablets. Sweden was, in fact, one of the pioneering countries globally to introduce computers into schools, a practice that started around 45 years ago (Riis, 2000). At both national and local levels, numerous initiatives have been launched to incorporate these devices into classroom activities (Tallvid, 2015). Sweden leads Europe in computer density, with 70 percent of all eighth-grade students possessing their own computers (Utbildningsdepartementet, 2017). The other Scandinavian nations exhibit similar levels of computer density. Consequently, the application of digital technology is deeply integrated into the practices of Swedish schools. Introducing a new technology or a prohibition in such an environment may prove to be ineffective.

            <h3>Institutional details</h3>
            <p>
                Mobile phone usage in Sweden has been on the rise in recent years, particularly among young adolescents and children. A comparison of ownership rates for the 15-16 age group reveals considerable similarity between the UK and Sweden. According to The Internet Foundation in Sweden (IIS, 2016), 98% of all young individuals aged 16-25 possessed their own smartphone in 2016; this figure rose to 100% by 2018 (IIS, 2018). In the UK, 95% of 16-24-year-olds owned a smartphone in 2018 (Ofcom, 2018).

            <h3>Main results</h3>
            <p>
                To begin, we assess the common trends assumption by graphing the yearly "treatment" effect for grade points both before and after the implementation of the mobile phone ban, as shown in Fig. 2. Our analysis displays the outcomes for up to five periods preceding and following the ban, with the year immediately before the treatment serving as the baseline. The sixth year, both before and after the baseline, consolidates all years beyond the fifth year, respectively. For a causal analysis, greater emphasis should be placed on the years immediately surrounding the implementation.
            </p>

            <h3>Discussion and concluding remarks</h3>
            <p>
                This research contributes to the very limited collection of studies employing quasi-experimental methods to examine the effects of prohibiting mobile phones. By utilizing Sweden as a new case study and encompassing all Swedish secondary schools, we leverage variations in the timing of implementation to determine that there is no enhancement in student performance at schools that have enacted a mobile phone ban. Consequently, we are unable to corroborate the findings of B&M. Numerous potential factors could explain why our conclusions diverge from theirs.
