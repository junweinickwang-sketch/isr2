            <p>For those who are educators or parents, the escalating trend of implementing smartphone bans within schools is a significant development that cannot be ignored. At the time of this publication, legislation prohibiting or limiting cellphone use in schools has been passed in eight states, alongside innumerable similar initiatives at the county, district, and individual school levels.</p>
            <p>Such prohibitions stem from a place of suitable and deliberate concern, as parents and students share anxieties over the well-documented effects on learners' mental well-being, their ability to maintain engagement during lessons, and their challenges with focusing for extended durations without shifting tasks.</p>
            <p>Speaking as both a parent and an educator, I possess a profound understanding of and empathy for these worries. My experience includes being a student, a teacher, and a principal within some of the most challenging and inadequately funded schools in the United States. I am passionately committed to two primary goals: ensuring children learn to read effectively and helping them cultivate significant relationships with adults. These two factors are strong indicators of favorable life outcomes, ranging from social stability to financial prosperity, and my professional life has been devoted to creating educational environments that nurture both.</p>

            <p>For this reason, I maintain that the powerful connection between students and their mobile phones must be acknowledged. During my time as a teacher and subsequently a principal, belonging to a different generation meant it required a period of adjustment for me to grasp this concept completely. Initially, phones seemed to be an obstacle separating me from the learners I was instructing. I was responsible for 10th-grade students who were reading at a 3rd-grade proficiency, and it was imperative for me to find a way to bridge this academic divide, which I recognized could profoundly alter their future health and economic opportunities.</p>
            <p>A pivotal moment of understanding occurred for me when I realized a device could function as an instrument and an entryway to education, rather than solely as a hindrance. The current situation in modern classrooms is that students are used to the presence of their phones and have become adept at interacting seamlessly with technology. For numerous children, particularly in districts without the funds to supply other devices, their phone functions as a calculator, a translation tool, a compact computer, and a portal to information.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, there has been a significant increase in powerful digital learning tools available to educators, a large number of which are application-based. These resources enable students to stay engaged for longer durations, advance through their educational paths at a personalized rate, and liberate crucial teacher time for targeted small-group work and social-emotional development.</p>
            
            <blockquote>We find ourselves rejecting technology precisely at the time when we could, and ought to, be embracing it more fully.</blockquote>

            <p>I had a conversation recently with an educator who incorporates a group-based vocabulary video game into her classroom activities. The students engage with the game while she provides direct instruction to a small cohort. Utilizing these small groups has allowed her to forge stronger connections with her students, which in turn helps her identify who is ready for more advanced material and who might benefit from a different learning approach. This method ensures that every student's academic and social-emotional requirements are addressed, despite their activities being organized in various ways.</p>
            <p>A substantial body of classroom experience and academic studies already indicates that an instructional approach aided by technology can be beneficial. A great number of teachers have adopted digital resources to create personalized mathematics lessons, and methodologically sound research has substantiated the positive effects of certain programs. Individual school districts have expressed enthusiasm for one-to-one computing initiatives and digital teaching innovations, noting increased student engagement and cooperation that enhance learning outcomes. For example, in the Savannah-Chatham County public school system in Georgia, the use of voice-recognition technology has been credited with reducing the percentage of students reading below the 25th percentile by seven percent.</p>
            <p>The promise and potential of rapidly evolving generative AI presents us with even greater opportunities to leverage technology to enhance the value of classroom time, particularly by removing obstacles that have frequently affected underserved populations. Within a classroom where reading abilities may vary widely among students, technology emerges as a potent instrument for tailoring the educational experience. For example, adaptive tools can customize reading assignments by translating texts and defining vocabulary, which empowers teachers to assist students across a spectrum of literacy skills, including those learning English, students with learning disabilities, and highly proficient readers.</p>

            <p>Many individuals will correctly assert that banning cellphones does not inherently forbid the adoption of new educational technologies. They are right: ensuring every student has access to a personal, modern device would address this issue. However, the execution of one-to-one technology programs often proves inadequate, as insufficient funding, obsolete equipment, and inconsistent home internet access disadvantage many students from low-income families. Concurrently, data from the Pew Research Center indicates that over 95 percent of teenagers either own or can access a smartphone, making it a nearly universal device for young people across different socioeconomic statuses. Furthermore, the National Center for Education Statistics reports that more than half of the students who do not have Wi-Fi access at home via a computer can still get online using a smartphone.</p>
            <p>In essence, we are distancing ourselves from technology at the very juncture when we could and should be integrating it more deeply. Indeed, this requires investigation, caution, and deliberate execution, but are these not the hallmarks of all effective instruction?</p>
            <p>It is imperative for us to understand that not all forms of screen time are equivalent. As we progress, managing suitable amounts of exposure and encouraging responsible technology habits will be essential, yet the repercussions of maintaining the current instructional methods are severe, particularly for the most disadvantaged students.</p>
            <p>We are currently facing a significant literacy crisis. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 71 percent of 8th-grade students in the United States performed below the "proficient" level in reading in 2022. We are witnessing lackluster improvements in literacy from year to year and persistent lags in academic performance. In the absence of the capacity to guarantee modern, one-to-one technology in every school, we must utilize every available resource. Removing smartphones from the equation under the current circumstances is an unequivocally misguided endeavor.</p>
