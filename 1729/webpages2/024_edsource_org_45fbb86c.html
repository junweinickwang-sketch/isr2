            <h1>Why Smartphones Should Be Removed From K-12 Classrooms</h1>
            <h2>The presence of smartphones and other mobile devices conflicts with the fundamental goals of education.</h2>

            <div class="article-meta">
                <p><strong>By Heath Madom</strong></p>
                <p>Published on June 26, 2023</p>
            </div>

            <p>During the previous autumn, a significant challenge emerged for me and my fellow educators: the widespread use of smartphones in our classes had become uncontrolled, and we found it difficult to manage.</p>
            <p>This issue was not characterized by students openly browsing social media or engaging in games like Clash Royale. The usage was more subtle, involving students checking their devices in frequent, brief intervals to send a quick message, view a notification, or sometimes watch a short TikTok video. However, these interruptions occurred numerous times throughout a single class session, and the cumulative distraction severely compromised the students' capacity to concentrate on their schoolwork.</p>
            <p>To address this challenge, our team collectively implemented a strict zero-tolerance policy for smartphones at the beginning of the spring term. Students were given a clear warning at the commencement of each class, after which any visible phone was confiscated for the remainder of the period. We meticulously recorded infractions for each student across all our classes, and any student whose phone was taken more than once was reported to the school administration for further action. Remarkably, within just a few days of introducing this new rule, smartphone use in our classrooms virtually disappeared, which felt like an incredible success.</p>
            <p>This anecdote is shared not to propose it as a universally scalable solution, but rather to demonstrate the significant problem that phones represent in educational settings now. The issue has become so pronounced that I am convinced the time has come to prohibit them from schools entirely. Several high schools have already taken this exact step, a decision that is entirely understandable. The functionality of smartphones is in direct opposition to the core purpose of an educational environment. It is impossible to maintain focus on other tasks while simultaneously engaged with a phone.</p>
            <p>A reasonable counterargument might be to question why all schools don't simply enforce strict no-usage policies, similar to the one my colleagues and I implemented. However, this approach is not a comprehensive solution for two primary reasons.</p>
            <p>The first reason is that policing smartphone usage often results in confrontational power struggles that can negatively impact the relationship between teachers and students. Students, much like adults, have a strong attachment to their mobile devices; therefore, even a successful confiscation can potentially damage the rapport with the student. Throughout my teaching career, nearly every significant conflict I have encountered with students has revolved around phone use. I have experienced students leaving the classroom in anger or even using profane language when I have insisted they surrender their device. This type of conflict ultimately generates more issues than it resolves.</p>
            <p>The second, and more critical, point is that the responsibility for policing smartphone use should not fall on teachers to begin with. The design of smartphones and social media applications is intentionally engineered to monopolize a user's attention. It is a widely acknowledged fact, yet our society continues to permit—and in many ways, encourage—high school students to carry these powerful distraction devices onto school grounds daily. One should consider the multitude of factors that result in a student having a phone in class: the vast financial investments in software and hardware, the extensive research aimed at maximizing user engagement, and the personal decision of parents to provide their child with a phone. These elements combine to implicitly support students bringing phones to school. It is therefore unreasonable to expect individual educators to single-handedly prevent teenagers from using these highly engaging devices.</p>
            <p>Rather than imposing this responsibility on individual educators, a cultural shift within schools is necessary, making the presence of a smartphone in a classroom as unacceptable as smoking would be; it simply would not be done. The most effective method to start this transformation would be for the California Department of Education to release official policy guidance declaring that student access to phones should be prohibited during school hours, which effectively means banning phones from classrooms. For students who must bring a phone to school, a system could be implemented where they deposit their device at the main office before their first class, utilizing options like phone lockers. Such a measure would relieve teachers and administrators from the duty of enforcing separate, individual bans. A statewide policy would instead establish a clear and universal prohibition for both students and parents.</p>
            <p>It is important to acknowledge that a complete ban has potential disadvantages, chief among them being the elimination of structured, supervised environments where adolescents can learn to cultivate a healthy relationship with their phones. Since screens and mobile technology are an integral part of modern life, a valid argument exists that educators have a duty to instruct students on how to manage the constant stream of notifications and the allure of digital distraction. Furthermore, there are occasional instances where smartphones can serve as valuable educational tools in a lesson, using applications such as Kahoot or Poll Everywhere. Lastly, a significant concern for some parents may be that a ban could impede their ability to contact their child in an emergency situation.</p>
            <p>Although I am receptive to these counterarguments, my firsthand experience as an educator observing how phones decimate student focus leads me to conclude that these points are not compelling enough. For emergency communications, every school office and classroom I am familiar with is equipped with a landline phone. More importantly, our fundamental responsibility as educators is to establish environments conducive to learning that serve the best interests of our students. The presence of smartphones directly conflicts with both of these objectives, not to mention the documented risks they pose to adolescent mental health. Therefore, if our true priority is the well-being and academic success of students, it is imperative for California to spearhead the movement to remove phones from K-12 learning spaces.</p>

                <p>From my perspective as a music teacher, mobile phones are entirely inappropriate within a rehearsal environment or during actual performances. Although many musicians, including myself, utilize social media for promotional purposes, achieving complete focus from a large group during a rehearsal is unfeasible without a clear policy on phone use. This principle also applies to educational settings that involve hands-on skills like welding, painting, or other crafts. It is not possible to be scrolling on a phone and simultaneously ensure the quality of one's work is perfect.</p>

                <p>In my view, there is little justification for most children, particularly those under the age of 16 or 17, to even possess cellphones. Despite this, mobile carriers introduced "friends and family" plans long before the advent of smartphones, and the situation deteriorated rapidly once smartphones became dominant. I have never been married nor had children, but if I had, I would have set that minimum age as the absolute earliest my children could own one.</p>

                <p>I concur completely; phones ought to be forbidden in schools. Parents often insist on them for safety in the event of a school shooting. However, our children are falling behind academically, and the cellphone is a major contributing factor to this issue. I am aware of students who use their phones to cheat on examinations. Our focus should be on teaching children how to concentrate, maintain focus, and truly learn.</p>

                <p>I have considered all the viewpoints and I recognize the concept of incorporating technology into classroom instruction. The challenge is that a large number of teachers lack the necessary skills to do this effectively. This approach is putting the cart before the horse. Until technology integration is a standard component of their training, cell phones will continue to compete with educators for students' attention. With such distractions present in the classroom, children will never be able to learn properly. I have a son who is eight years old, and while technology is not yet a problem for him, I can assure you that if he has a phone in class and his teacher doesn't know how to integrate it, it will certainly become a distraction. Cell phones are detrimental to children's education because many teachers are neither qualified nor trained to use technology as an instructional tool as part of their degree program. The training must be completed first before considering its use in the classroom. Otherwise, it will remain a distraction, and you will not be able to keep children engaged unless you devise a method for collecting cell phones during class time.</p>

                <p>I have been an educator since 1989, and I can say the cellphone represents the single greatest distraction for students. The anxiety associated with being separated from a cellphone exists not only among students but also among parents.</p>

                <p>We are in the year 2023, and cell phones have been an impediment to student learning since 2007. This is a point of agreement for every teacher in every country. I was taken aback when I saw this article, as it feels like old news. What you fail to mention is the constant communication that occurs between students during the school day, with messages like, "Find me in the restroom," or "A fight is happening in the cafeteria," and "A fight is scheduled to happen after school." Students are also provoking teachers, hoping for a reaction they can record on video. The impact on learning is only one part of the problem. I am employed at a school that now collects phones, and I would seek employment elsewhere if this policy were not in place.</p>

                <p>The prohibition of cell phones is simply a symptom of a K-12 educational system that is completely misaligned with the contemporary world. Educators tend to concentrate on these fabricated crises to sidestep the genuine problems that K-12 education faces, which include blatant and systemic racism, as well as teachers and administrators who are inadequately trained in subject matter, teaching methods, and evaluation techniques. For students who genuinely need to acquire math skills, cell phones can be a source of salvation. They provide access to powerful graphing calculators and valuable math lessons on platforms like Khan Academy. Is it possible that students are turning to TikTok because they are utterly bored by traditional methods like solving homework problems on the board? Educators should self-reflect and enhance their teaching practices by integrating the use of smartphones into their lessons. It is time to embrace these new technologies instead of behaving like Luddites by rejecting them!</p>

                <p>That is an oversimplification. I actively use technology in my classroom; we are equipped with Chromebooks. I find it interesting how you disregard the facts mentioned by the author about how phones, apps, and games are specifically designed to capture the attention of children. I have students who are genuinely addicted to technology, which is not beneficial for them in a classroom setting. While I do incorporate educational tools like Prodigy and Blooket in my teaching, it makes no difference how engaging my lessons are when teachers are in competition with platforms like TikTok; we will consistently lose to the influence of their peers. The technology they engage with directly stimulates the reward center of their brains, releasing dopamine. So, according to you, it is the teacher's fault, and we are somehow expected to counteract the chemical reactions in their brains; we are in a literal competition with dopamine.</p>

                <p>The separation you make between the distraction and educational harm from cell phones and broader systemic issues is a false dichotomy. It is possible for us to tackle systemic educational problems while also addressing the issue of cell phones. Regarding your assertion that cell phones are a "salvation for students who actually need to learn math skills," are you able to provide any research studies that substantiate such a statement? Cell phones are not entirely negative, but they are not an unqualified benefit either. As a society, it is important that we establish limits on screen time, and schools are a logical venue for these limits to be implemented.</p>

                <p>I observed identical problems in my high school classroom upon our return to in-person instruction. I installed two hanging shoe organizers, and as students enter the classroom, they are required to place their phones and any other wireless devices inside. This has been a transformative change. Surprisingly, I have encountered very little resistance, particularly from parents. One challenge I continue to face is the persistent ability of students to distract themselves online while using their laptops, which presents a double-edged sword given the academic freedom required for the research courses I teach.</p>

                <p>Considering the integration of cell phone use into our lessons alongside teaching digital citizenship is a crucial perspective. The cell phone has evolved into an indispensable tool in our everyday lives, which makes it logical to incorporate it into our curriculum as we prepare students for what lies ahead. By recognizing the importance of cell phones, we can examine both their potential advantages and disadvantages, and guide students on how to use them in a responsible manner. This method enables us to address problems such as teen depression, suicide, and bullying, which can be affected by cell phone usage. Instead of ignoring the issue, we can provide students with the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate the digital landscape effectively. Let us continue this conversation to find ways to integrate cell phones into our teaching and encourage responsible use among students.</p>

                <p>I am in agreement that we should instruct students on the responsible use of these devices. However, this instruction can occur in a world where phones are not permitted in classrooms. We could establish a dedicated media literacy class where students are taught and can practice methods for having a healthy relationship with their smartphones. They can be empowered to use them responsibly while also mitigating the harm and distraction that arise when they are simply allowed everywhere.</p>

                <p>Dr. Skaggs, you are requesting that I add even more lessons into an already overloaded semester dedicated to miraculously improving reading comprehension levels from a 3rd-grade to an 11th-grade standard, teaching grammar to students who cannot distinguish between a subject and a verb, and guiding semi-literate adolescents to compose multiple critical analysis essays. I am already expected to accomplish this while providing differentiated instruction for students with IEPs, 504s, and for English Language Learners, as well as focusing on Social-Emotional Learning. What you are asking is not feasible in my classroom. It might be feasible in yours, if you have one, but I have a feeling yours is an exception. If you do not have a classroom, I ask that you please avoid pontificating about what teachers should be doing until you are in the trenches with the rest of us.</p>

                <p>I recognize how unrealistic it is to juggle the numerous expectations and injustices that the system has imposed on us as educators. Believe me, systems are flawlessly engineered to produce the results they are currently achieving, and unfortunately, our existing systems often add more of the same redundancies to "solve" problems, thereby continuing to yield the same outcomes. It seems that adding more paperwork and repeating the same actions under a different brand name is a frequent solution for many. I have personally been working in Special Education for nearly two decades, specializing in Emotional Disturbance. One of my approaches is to develop innovative ideas to support my students and give them a voice in their own education. When working with students who have severe behavioral needs and are prone to dysregulation, I aim to minimize confrontation and use reinforcers to help cultivate appropriate behavior (phones can be an excellent reinforcement tool). Here are several other ways we can integrate cell phones into lessons, which can sometimes even save time on grading, provide immediate feedback, and maintain student work samples and portfolios, all while teaching students reading, grammar, and writing, differentiating for various needs, and focusing on SEL. We can use apps to assist students in learning vocabulary and grammar. Numerous apps are available that can help students master new words and grammatical rules, which can be used for activities like flashcards, quizzes, or games. For instance, the "Vocabulary Builder" app enables students to create their own study materials, while "Grammarly" can assist with grammar and spelling checks. Cell phones can also be used for research, providing access to a wide range of online resources like encyclopedias, dictionaries, and news sites, which is an excellent way for students to gather information for critical analysis essays. Apps like "Quizlet" allow for the creation and sharing of flashcards, and "Google Scholar" facilitates searches for academic articles. Furthermore, cell phones can aid in collaborative projects through applications such as Google Docs, Google Slides, and Skype, allowing students to work together on shared documents or hold video conferences. They can also be used for self-reflection on learning through apps like "VoiceThread" and "Padlet," where students can record their thoughts or create digital portfolios of their work. For differentiating instruction, it's important to provide extra support for students with IEPs, 504s, and ELLs, such as step-by-step instructions or more time. Selecting age- and level-appropriate apps and creating a safe environment for practice are also crucial. Lastly, focusing on social-emotional learning (SEL) is key. This involves helping students develop skills like self-awareness and responsible decision-making. We can encourage them to use phones to connect positively with others, teach them healthy usage habits like setting boundaries, and use the devices to promote positive messages and social awareness. Thank you for reading, and I wish you the best. The teaching profession seems to become more challenging each year, and we are losing educators at a concerning rate. We must devise some innovative solutions and overhaul the system. Systems are structured to get the results they are getting, and I, for one, am not satisfied with the results we are currently achieving.</p>

                <p>Consider a scenario where a school shooting occurs and a student becomes trapped in a bathroom. Without a phone, they would be unable to make contact with their parents. Even if there are phones available in every classroom, students who are in the hallway could be herded into one of those rooms. This would result in a crowded room with numerous children all attempting to call their parents. You also asserted that "phones destroy student attention," but so do the sounds of gunshots in a hallway.</p>

                <p>As a retired middle school science teacher, I can completely appreciate the inclination to implement a ban. However, I chose a different path. I developed a comprehensive contract governing the use of what started as cell phones but eventually included smartphones, tablets, and wearable technology like the Apple Watch. The contract established rules for when, where, and how these devices could be utilized. For example, they could be used for collecting data during science experiments, listening to music during independent work, and conducting research. The terms of use stipulated requirements such as maintaining a certain minimum GPA, keeping the device flat on the desk where I could see it, prohibiting the sharing of earbuds, and not taking pictures of other students during data collection, among other things. Both parents and students were required to sign the contract. For the most part, this system was effective. By replacing a combative, policing dynamic around electronic devices with one that leveraged them as classroom tools, I saw a significant positive change. I would not claim that misuse was eliminated entirely, but it decreased by a very substantial margin. My students understood when they were permitted to use their devices, they would ask for permission to ensure it was appropriate, and they adhered to the rules they had agreed to. While our children are adept at entertaining themselves with smartphones, very few, in my observation, knew how to use the device as a learning tool. They are digital natives, and these devices are like a second nature to them. I hold the belief that we have an obligation to teach them the proper way, time, and place to use them. This was my personal experience in a middle school classroom setting. Many other teachers at my school and within the district adopted my contract, and to my knowledge, they continue to use it.</p>

                <p>Rob, thank you for sharing your experience and viewpoint; I truly value it. I concur that we bear a responsibility to educate students on the appropriate and timely use of smartphones, and that these devices can indeed serve explicit educational functions. I am in agreement with that. However, when weighing the pros and cons, I believe the negatives surpass the positives to such an extent that in educational environments, the default should be their unavailability. Nearly any education-related task that can be performed on a smartphone can also be accomplished on a laptop. While laptop use in the classroom can present its own set of problems, they are not nearly as severe as those posed by smartphones. Regarding the instruction on how to use them, we could offer a dedicated class where students learn and practice techniques to reduce phone-related distractions, such as using greyscale mode or disabling notifications. I recall taking a typing class in middle school that taught me how to type, and that was the only class where I used a computer. I believe a similar approach could be applied to smartphones, especially for students in the 7th and 8th grades. One of the issues, in my opinion, is that as a society, we have not been deliberate enough in designating times when screen use is inappropriate. Consequently, screens have become the default in all situations. I think schools can serve a vital function in establishing spaces where screen time is restricted. This could potentially help to counteract some of the broader negative impacts of screens and their associated social media platforms that I did not fully explore in my piece but are nevertheless concerning, such as depression and isolation.</p>

                <p>It is baffling to me how anyone could find fault with anything you have stated. I have had students conceal their phones in their undergarments to avoid surrendering them, even during examinations. Parents have threatened to take legal action against me for confiscating their children's phones, which they claim are necessary in case of a school shooting—the very situation in which phones should never be used, as they can help identify targets. Students blatantly play video games against one another in class, and teachers are ultimately left without the authority to control it. Furthermore, as you pointed out at the conclusion of your commentary, research confirms that phones have a detrimental effect on mental health, particularly among young women. There is an appropriate time and place for phones, but classrooms are neither the right place nor the right time. One need only look at the phone policies of high-achieving countries: they are prohibited. The choice before us is straightforward: do we wish to raise a generation of individuals who are undereducated and potentially face emotional challenges, or do we want to foster healthy, well-educated students?</p>

                <p>Brian, I am in complete agreement and have experienced similar situations. Students discover highly creative methods to hide their phones while still managing to engage with the content on the screen. A colleague of mine once confiscated a smartphone from a student who had secured it inside his shoe to watch a Premier League soccer match. I suppose he managed to make it appear as though he was working, when in fact he was looking down at his feet to watch the game.</p>

                <p>A complete ban on cell phones in schools is both impractical and unsafe, a fact that anyone who has experienced an on-campus emergency can confirm. My vote is for making cellphone lockers a standard feature within classrooms. This would allow students to secure their phones in a locker upon entering the room and retrieve them upon leaving. The lockers could have an indicator light to show which compartments are in use. Each student would be given a unique code that is compatible with any locker in the school. This system would still permit students to access their phones for educational activities or in the case of an emergency if needed. It is time for us to update our classroom management systems and methods to adapt to these changing times.</p>

                <p>Rachel, thank you for this suggestion; I would definitely support such an idea. It is possible that the nuance of my position was lost due to the op-ed format, but when I referred to a ban from classrooms, I was indeed thinking of a cellphone locker system as one possible solution. Many of my students depend on their phones after school to manage their daily lives, such as coordinating work schedules, communicating with parents, and picking up younger siblings, so I would want them to have access to their devices once the school day has concluded. Regarding safety, the staff at my school received training this year indicating that the best procedure during a school shooting or a similar crisis is for everyone to remain silent and to stay off their phones. The very need for such training is a shameful reflection on our society, and I do recognize those concerns. However, I believe that immediate communication with parents, once it is safe to do so, can still be achieved without phones in the classroom by using school-wide communication systems, such as the ParentSquare platform we use in the Oakland Unified School District.</p>

                <p>The "emergency contact" argument is not a strong one. Non-smart cell phones, which are capable of making calls only, can now be purchased for as little as $20 and have monthly service costs of just pennies. Smart phones are simply too significant a distraction during school hours.</p>

                <p>I am in full agreement with the position against distraction. When John Deasy served as the Superintendent for the Los Angeles Unified School District, he proposed providing every student with an iPad. This was the worst idea imaginable.</p>
