<p>We invite you to read our <a href="/blog/new-york-and-other-states-enact-more-school-cell-phone-bans-restrictions/">subsequent blog post</a>, which analyzes the definitive cell phone ban policy included in the Enacted Budget for New York State's Fiscal Year 2026.</p>
<p><em><u>A Note from the Editor</u>: This analysis now contains updated information within the table titled, "State-Wide Ban or Restriction in Effect."</em></p>
</div>
<p>The educational landscape is continually being transformed by technology, which offers benefits such as the capacity for developing more <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/01/technology-driven-education-a-new-era-of-learning/">engaging lesson plans</a>, the convenience of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666412722000137">inviting guest speakers</a> from any location, and the enhancement of <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/02/technology-in-education">data gathering for customized learning experiences</a>. However, notwithstanding the general benefits of technology, a significant number of educators and school leaders contend that the specific <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/06/12/72-percent-of-us-high-school-teachers-say-cellphone-distraction-is-a-major-problem-in-the-classroom/">distraction caused by cell phones</a> negates their potential educational worth. In response to these issues, school administrators and state legislators have established a range of policies governing the use of cell phones and other devices in schools, which span from simple reminders managed by teachers to more stringent prohibitions at the district and state levels. Although these regulations are commonly known as school cell phone “bans,” the actual definition of a ban can vary considerably between different districts, states, or nations. Similarly, these policies are typically presented as limitations on cell phones, but they more specifically target smartphones and other devices with internet connectivity.</p>
<p>In alignment with these kinds of efforts, New York Governor Kathy Hochul revealed a provision to limit the use of internet-connected devices for the entire school day while she presented her <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-plan-restrict-smartphone-use-schools-statewide-and-ensure-distraction">2026 Executive Budget Proposal</a>. To help enact the policy, districts would formulate their own plans for implementation, and the budget would set aside $13.5 million for school districts to acquire phone storage pouches or similar devices. The proposed rules would become effective in the 2025-26 academic year and mandate compliance from all public school districts, charter schools, and Boards of Cooperative Education Services (BOCES). Exemptions from these restrictions could be granted to students with medical requirements or those who have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that requires the use of an internet-connected device, while students would still be permitted to use non-internet-capable phones and internet-enabled devices for educational activities in the classroom.</p>
<p>As this proposal is being reviewed by state policymakers, educators, and families, this article provides a summary of the current research on cell phone use in schools and its effect on academic outcomes, details recent state-level restrictions and their background, and reviews the existing district-level policies throughout New York.</p>
<h5><strong>The Connection Between Cell Phone Use and Academic Achievement</strong></h5>
<p>The causal impact of cell phone usage in schools on academic performance has been a key area of interest for researchers, although many of the studies to date have been performed outside of the United States. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537116300136">A particular study</a>, using data from four cities in England, revealed that students between the ages of 11 and 16 showed improved academic results after their schools prohibited cell phones, even though <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3617386">Swedish researchers</a> discovered no correlation between school cell phone bans and academic achievement when they repeated the study with a different group. Meanwhile, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/kykl.12214">a different study</a> that centered on first-year university students in Belgium determined that greater smartphone use was linked to lower test scores.</p>
<p>Some research has been conducted to assess the effectiveness of more current cell phone restriction policies within the United States. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/64e4ceeeb7f5fd21cba8b71c/t/6661da11a924ca663f45cb1f/1732055220340/Yondr+in+Education+White+Paper.pdf">A 2024 study by Yondr</a>, a well-known manufacturer of cell phone pouches, analyzed over 37,000 final course grades in middle and high schools, collected both before and after the introduction of phone restrictions. The findings showed that student academic success rates rose by 6.27% after the implementation of pouch-based restrictions, and there was a 38% higher likelihood of passing grades in academic-focused classes for students in the 11th and 12th grades. Additionally, the study noted a 44% reduction in the average monthly number of behavioral referrals and a 74% consensus among teachers that students were more focused and engaged in class after the restrictions were put in place compared to before. While these studies offer valuable perspectives on the effects of cell phone restrictions using phone pouches, additional research is required to fully grasp how cell phones influence learning outcomes and to determine the effectiveness of various cell phone restriction methods in K-12 schools across the United States.</p>
<h5><strong>Consequences of Heightened Cell Phone and Social Media Activity</strong></h5>
<p>Although there is limited data to quantify the learning effects of cell phone use during the academic year, educators express apprehension that internet-enabled devices represent a significant distraction throughout the school day. Furthermore, a <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12888-019-2350-x.pdf">substantial body of established research</a> indicates that the more time a child dedicates to using smartphones, the higher the risk of adverse mental health outcomes. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/06/12/72-percent-of-us-high-school-teachers-say-cellphone-distraction-is-a-major-problem-in-the-classroom/">One particular study</a> revealed that almost three-fourths of high school teachers and a third of middle school teachers view cell phone use as a significant distraction.</p>
<p>A Pew Research <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/">study</a> from 2018 showed that 95% of teenagers had a smartphone and 45% of those surveyed reported being online almost constantly. Additional <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2023-cs-smartphone-research-report_final-for-web.pdf">research</a> by Common Sense Media and the University of Michigan found that 97 percent of 11- to 17-year-olds with phones who participated in their study used their devices during school hours, with the average duration of use being 43 minutes. That same study also discovered that, on average, these students received 237 notifications daily, with a quarter of them arriving during school time. The average American teen <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2024/04/teen-social-use-mental-health">dedicates 4.8 hours per day to social media</a>, with an estimated 87 percent of this time spent on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2749480">A particular study indicated</a> that for teens and children who use social media for over three hours daily, the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/youth-mental-health/social-media/index.html">risk of experiencing negative mental health effects</a> doubles. A separate analysis likewise concluded that the <a href="https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/research/research-areas/child-and-adolescent-psychiatry/sultan-lab-mental-health-informatics/research-areas/smartphones-social-media-and-their-impact-mental-health#:~:text=Smartphones%20have%20transformed%20the%20way,to%20increased%20anxiety%20and%20stress.">continuous presence of smartphones can heighten anxiety</a>, and that the perpetual comparisons to peers' lives on social media can diminish feelings of self-worth and contribute to increased depression. A growing consensus, supported by <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/12/2692">longitudinal studies</a> and a few causal studies, suggests that cell phone use has detrimental effects on mental health outcomes. These conclusions are also situated within the larger picture of worrying trends that indicate a rise in mental health challenges among adolescents. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0213-yrbs.html">Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> reported that in 2021, nearly three out of five teenage girls experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0213-yrbs.html">CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey</a> further revealed that nearly one in three high school students had seriously contemplated suicide in the past year, marking a 60% increase over the last decade.</p>
<p style="line-height: 250%; text-align: left; padding: 18px 0px 33px 0px;"><span style="font-size: xx-large; color: #009ee0;"><strong>A growing consensus from longitudinal and some causal studies indicates that cell phone usage negatively impacts mental health outcomes.</strong></span></p>
<h5><strong>The Historical Development of Cell Phone Prohibitions</strong></h5>
<p>Schools have been grappling with how to mitigate the distractions and potential dangers posed by cell phones almost since their introduction. The cell phones developed in the 1980s were markedly different from the smartphones we have today. These initial mobile phones were limited to making calls; however, in 1992, short message service (SMS) texting was <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-sms-text-message-sent">created</a>. In contrast, modern devices function as handheld computers, enabling users to engage with social media, browse the internet, manage emails, play games, and much more through a wide array of applications for both personal and professional activities.</p>
<p>Before the extensive use of cell phones, pagers, also referred to as beepers, were a prevalent technology in the <a href="https://www.spok.com/blog/throwback-thursday-history-pagers/">1980s and 1990s</a>. Pagers are telecommunication devices that can receive and show alphanumeric or voice messages. These <a href="https://www.hypercare.com/blog/the-evolution-of-communication-what-is-a-two-way-pager">gadgets</a> can offer either one-way communication (receiving messages only) or two-way communication (capable of both sending and receiving messages). While pagers are now most frequently linked with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/08/1197955913/doctors-pagers-beepers">doctors</a> and used in medical environments, high school students also used them during the 1980s and 1990s, which created a potential source of distraction. In 1988, school officials in Dade County, Florida, prohibited students from carrying pagers, labeling them as, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/25/us/schools-responding-to-beeper-tool-of-today-s-drug-dealer-by-banning-it.html">the most dominant symbol of the drug trade</a>.” Representatives from the pager industry contested this claim, arguing that pagers are wrongly linked to the drug trade and that students have valid reasons for using them. Nevertheless, in 1988, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/25/us/schools-responding-to-beeper-tool-of-today-s-drug-dealer-by-banning-it.html">50 additional school districts</a> nationwide banned pagers, which included a <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2001-2002/billanalysis/House/htm/2001-HLA-4991-b.htm">state-level prohibition for schools in Michigan</a>. Then, in 1989, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/28/nx-s1-5021605/school-cellphone-bans-new-york-city#:~:text=In%201989%2C%20Maryland%20ushered%20in,spike%20in%20illegal%20drug%20sales">Maryland</a> was the first state to pass a ban on both cell phones and pagers in schools, with a focus on stopping classroom disturbances and tackling safety issues, such as limiting in-school communication among students who might be engaged in illegal activities. This prohibition carried quite severe penalties, where students could be fined up to $2,500 or serve six months in jail for breaking the law. Since that time, <a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/a-look-at-state-efforts-to-ban-cellphones-in-schools-and-implications-for-youth-mental-health/#:~:text=Cellphone%20bans%20began%20decades%20ago,again%20to%2076%25%20in%202021.">an increasing number of schools</a>, cities, and states have taken steps to limit cell phone use in schools, though this has happened in a very inconsistent manner over the years: for instance, in 2009, 91 percent of public schools were reported to have banned cell phones; this figure dropped to 66 percent by 2015, then climbed back to 76 percent by 2021. The precise reasons for these fluctuations are not clear, but some groups, including <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/parents-pushback-on-cellphone-bans-at-school">parents</a>, have at times resisted cell phone bans. Furthermore, as technology has advanced and broadened the functions of related devices—like Bluetooth headphones, smart watches, and smart glasses—policies at the school, district, and state levels have been updated to include these new technologies.</p>
<h5><strong>Recent State-Level Actions on Cell Phones in Educational Settings</strong></h5>
<p>In the past two years, a number of states have taken legislative or administrative steps to create policies that either restrict or forbid the use of cell phones in schools. Florida established the first statewide mandate for schools to limit cell phone use during instructional periods in May 2024. This policy also forbade the use of social media platforms on devices connected to the school district's Wi-Fi and mandated that students receive instruction in digital literacy starting in the sixth grade. Certain school districts in Florida, like the <a href="https://www.ocps.net/students_and_parents/student_cell_phone_policy#:~:text=Wireless%20communication%20devices%20(including%20earbuds,a%20teacher%20for%20educational%20purposes.">Orange County Public Schools</a>, enacted even more stringent rules, banning cell phone use for the entire duration of the school day. Although a statewide assessment of the policy has not yet been conducted, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/technology/florida-school-cellphone-tiktok-ban.html">school personnel have noted</a> fewer distractions during teaching times and more significant social interactions among students throughout the school day in the brief time since the policy was implemented.</p>
<p><a href="https://legiscan.com/LA/bill/SB207/2024">Louisiana</a> also passed a law in 2024 that restricts both the use and possession of cell phones for the entire school day, which means if a student brings a cell phone to school, it must be switched off and put away during school hours. Last year, <a href="https://legiscan.com/IN/text/SB0185/id/2935758">Indiana also enacted legislation</a> that prohibits the use of any portable wireless device (such as cell phones, gaming devices, laptops, and tablets) during class time in schools across the state. The law notes that exceptions exist, including: if a teacher permits students to use a device for educational activities, if a student uses a device as specified in their individualized education plan (IEP) for a disability or another plan, in emergencies, or for healthcare reasons. The law also mandates that each school district must formulate policies for device use during non-instructional periods like lunchtime.</p>
<p>Some other states have required that school districts formulate their own specific policies. The <a href="https://www.house.mn.gov/NewLaws/story/2024/5579">law in Minnesota</a> directs school districts and charter schools to develop and put into effect official policies concerning cell phone use by March 15, 2025. In <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/02/10/minnesota-weighs-cell-phone-ban-in-elementary-middle-schools">February 2025</a>, Minnesota legislators proposed another <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1799225">bill</a> that would more directly limit cell phones and smart watches in elementary and middle schools, and also restrict their use in high school classrooms. This latest proposal includes exceptions for essential medical purposes and for students with disabilities. The <a href="https://governor.ohio.gov/media/news-and-media/governor-dewine-signs-bill-requiring-ohio-schools-to-create-cell-phone-policies">law in Ohio</a> mandates that every school district must establish its own rules regarding cell phone use during the school day by July 1, 2025. This legislation provides for exceptions for students who need a cell phone to manage health conditions or for educational purposes as decided by school authorities. The State Board of Education in South Carolina recently completed its <a href="httpshttps://ed.sc.gov/newsroom/school-district-memoranda-archive/cell-phone-policy/cell-phone-policy-memo/">statewide policy</a> in September 2024, which forbids students from accessing unauthorized electronic devices unless it is specifically for educational or health reasons, or for students who are part of emergency response organizations. Every school district in South Carolina that gets state funds had to implement this policy by January 2025. Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia released <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-33—-Cell-Phones-7.9.24.pdf">Executive Order 33</a> in July 2024, instructing state officials to: gather public feedback on cell phone use in schools, establish definitions for "cell phone-free education," and issue model implementation strategies and policy guidelines to help public school systems shape their phone policies. This executive order also allocated $500,000 in state funding to aid in the rollout of school cell phone policies. In California, during the autumn of 2024, the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/23/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-to-limit-the-use-of-smartphones-during-school-hours/#:~:text=What%20you%20need%20to%20know:%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom%20today%20signed">Governor approved</a> the <a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB3216/id/2965936#:~:text=California%20Assembly%20Bill%203216.%20NOTE:%20There%20are%20more%20recent">Phone-Free Act</a>, which requires that school districts and charter schools enact a phone policy that either limits or bans smartphone use during school hours by July 1, 2026. This act permits exemptions for medical needs, emergencies, educational activities, or with the consent of faculty. More recently, <a href="https://governor.arkansas.gov/news_post/governor-sanders-announces-bill-to-make-every-arkansas-school-go-phone-free/#:~:text=%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Sarah%20Huckabee%20Sanders%20today,the%202025%2D2026%20school%20year.">in February 2025,</a> <a href="https://arkleg.state.ar.us/Home/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2025R%2FPublic%2FSB142.pdf">Arkansas passed a law</a> that requires every school district and charter school to establish a "bell-to-bell" policy before the 2025-2026 school year, which limits possession and forbids the use of a personal electronic device during the school day. This legislation allows for exemptions for students with IEPs, students who are concurrently enrolled in a higher education institution and need to use two-factor authentication for their coursework, and for emergencies or special occasions.</p>
<p>These kinds of initiatives continue to be proposed as worries about student cell phone and social media use remain. For instance, in January 2025, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell proposed the <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-campbell-introduces-the-study-act-to-promote-safe-technology-use-and-distraction-free-education-for-youth">Safe Technology Use and Distraction-free Education for Youth (STUDY) Act</a>. This proposed legislation would mandate that schools implement a "bell-to-bell" prohibition on cell phones and personal electronic devices, and also provide education to students about the adverse mental health effects linked to social media.</p>
<p>Federal lawmakers have also taken into account cell phone restrictions in the context of the guidance they offer to K-12 schools. In December 2024, the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-calls-states-districts-and-schools-adopt-policies-student-use-of-cell-phones-and-personal-devices">US Department of Education</a> advised that all states and districts should implement policies to regulate cell phone use in schools.

<h5><strong>Policies in New York</strong></h5>
<p>At present, in New York State, school policies on cell phones are a varied collection of decisions made at the district level, which include different methods for managing phone use in educational environments. For instance, the <a href="https://www.schoharieschools.org/scs-yondr-student-phone-policy-and-discipline-procedures/">Schoharie School District</a> started to limit cell phone access throughout the school day in 2022 by making students place their devices in <a href="https://www.overyondr.com/phone-locking-pouch">phone pouches,</a> which are secured with magnetic technology and are unsealed at the conclusion of classes. In a similar vein, the <a href="https://www.bethlehemschools.org/bchs-to-limit-cell-phone-use-with-yondr-pouches/">Bethlehem School District</a> introduced phone pouches in 2023, and the <a href="https://www.gasd.org/article/1687004">Greater Amsterdam School District</a> did so in 2024. The <a href="https://www.lackawannaschools.org/page/no-cell-phone-policy">Lackawanna School District</a> established a full-day cell phone restriction—known as "no cell from bell to bell"—that started in the 2024-25 school year and necessitated the use of phone pouches, which had an approximate cost of <a href="https://cbs6albany.com/news/crisis-in-the-classroom/district-finds-success-after-going-phone-free-with-the-help-of-yondr-social-media-use-negative-impact-bethlehem-central-school-classroom-participation-increased-mental-health-awareness">$25-30 per pouch</a>.</p>
<p>Other school districts, like <a href="https://www.news10.com/classroom-progress-report/these-capital-region-schools-are-going-phone-free/">Averill Park</a>, permit teachers to label their classroom as a 'green' or 'red' zone, which either allows or completely forbids the use of cell phones. The <a href="https://www.bcs1.org/codeofconduct">Brockport Central School District</a> bans cell phones in the classroom and provides "cell phone holders" for students to store their phones if they prefer not to use their lockers or backpacks for that purpose. Some larger school districts, such as the Rochester School District, permit different policies for each school: some schools, like <a href="https://www.rcsdk12.org/cms/lib/NY01001156/Centricity/Domain/4351/Cell%20phone%20policy.pdf">James Monroe Junior & High School</a>, collect phones daily, whereas others, like the <a href="https://www.rcsdk12.org/cms/lib/NY01001156/Centricity/Domain/4351/Cell%20phone%20policy.pdf">School of Arts</a>, require that phones be kept away in phone pouches. The latest proposal from Governor Kathy Hochul would maintain this varied approach, but would require schools to decide on a district-by-district basis how to limit the use of internet-capable devices during school hours. An examination of New York's districts and schools, as well as other states with more comprehensive policies, reveals a range of ways these policies can be designed and implemented, as detailed below.</p>

<p>New York City, which is the state's—and the country's—largest school district, put in place a cell phone policy <a href="https://pwsblobprd.schools.nyc/prd-pws/docs/default-source/default-document-library/a-413-english.pdf?sfvrsn=204732a3_44">starting in 2015</a> under the leadership of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. However, the subsequent mayoral administration, led by Bill de Blasio, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/nyregion/ban-on-cellphones-in-new-york-city-schools-to-be-lifted.html">reversed the policy</a>, reportedly because it was <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/public-school-cell-phone-ban-new-york/#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20Mayor%20Bill%20de,kids%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20de%20Blasio.">disliked by parents</a> and was difficult to enforce from a logistical standpoint. In the fall of 2024, Mayor Eric Adams and New York City Schools Chancellor David Banks <a href="https://cbs6albany.com/news/nation-world/nyc-schools-chief-pumps-brakes-on-cell-phone-ban-now-is-not-the-time-new-york-city-public-schools-david-banks-mayor-eric-adams-los-angeles-nevada-crisis-in-the-classroom">publicly discussed</a> the possibility of bringing back a district-wide policy, but stated that the time was not yet right for a ban, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-03/nyc-schools-reverse-course-on-cell-phone-ban-after-parents-balk">mentioning concerns from parents</a> who had difficulty contacting their children during recent lockdowns.</p>
<p>In New York City at present, individual schools have the authority to establish their own policies regarding cell phone use. Some schools gather cell phones at the start of the school day, utilizing a phone pouch or another storage method. Others within the district permit students to use their cell phones during any free periods, and yet other schools allow students to keep their cell phones with them all day, with use being restricted only if a teacher observes the phone being used in class.</p>
<p>There seems to be generally broad support for cell phone bans in New York from various groups. For instance, during a rally at the Capitol in Albany in support of a statewide ban, <a href="https://www.nysut.org/news/2024/december/media-release-cellphone">New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) president Melinda Person</a> remarked, “Research has demonstrated that implementing a phone-free school policy is one of the most effective actions you can take to improve student educational results, behavior, and overall well-being.” A poll from September 2024 revealed that <a href="https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/top-stories/new-york-teachers-union-calls-for-bell-to-bell-cell-phone-restrictions-in-schools/">85 percent of NYSUT members</a> supported a "bell-to-bell" ban. On a wider scale, a recent <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SNY-August-2024-Poll-Release-Final.pdf">Siena Research Institute poll</a> indicates that school smartphone bans have bipartisan public backing, with 60 percent of New York voters in favor of the ban, and this support is consistent across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the backing for cell phone restrictions in New York schools is not unanimous. <a href="https://ed.buffalo.edu/news-events.host.html/content/shared/ed/news/ticker/2024/10/08.detail.html">Dr. Katheryne T. Leigh-Osroosh</a>, an assistant professor of counseling, school, and educational psychology at the University at Buffalo, has commented, “While I commend the effort to investigate the effects of cell phone use on learning, I question whether these bans are more a reaction than a preventative measure.” She also added that schools ought to assist students in developing healthy relationships with technology and <a href="https://nynow.wmht.org/blogs/education/school-districts-continuing-to-tackle-cell-phone-use-in-the-classroom/">warned</a> that losing access to their phones could be perceived as an emotional loss by some students, akin to the sorrow felt when a significant aspect of one's identity is lost. Recently, New York State Educational Department Commissioner Betty Rosa and Board of Regents Chancellor Lester Young <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/politics/government/new-york-education-officials-concerned-about-cellphone-ban-amid-trump-s-deportations-plans/ar-AA1xL3Q0?ocid=BingNewsSerp">voiced specific worries</a> about the proposed cellphone ban, particularly in light of the Trump administration's plans to deport undocumented immigrants, suggesting that limiting a student's access to their cellphone could cause trauma and anxiety if they are unable to get in touch with their family.</p>
<h5><strong>Cell Phone Prohibitions and Emergency Situations</strong></h5>
<p>Worries about students' access to cell phones are not just confined to the recent issues mentioned, but are also connected to the devices' function in communication during other emergency situations, like a school shooting. A September 2024 survey conducted by the <a href="https://nationalparentsunion.org/2024/09/06/in-case-of-emergency-new-survey-finds-why-parents-parents-say-children-should-have-their-cell-phone-at-school/">National Parents Union</a>, a parent advocacy organization, revealed that among parents whose child brings a phone to school, 78 percent wanted their child to have a phone available for emergencies—a reason cited more than any other. The justification for allowing cell phones is that they would <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/insights/as-schools-consider-cell-phone-bans-cellular-connectivity-must-also-be-top-of-mind/163030/">enhance the speed of notifications</a> to first responders and allow parents to more rapidly <a href="https://learnsafe.com/student-cell-phones-in-school-crisis-situations-pros-and-cons/">confirm their child's safety</a>.</p>
<p>However, there are also <a href="https://schoolsecurity.org/trends/cell-phones-and-text-messaging-in-schools/#:~:text=Cell%20phone%20use%20by%20students%20can%20impede%20public%20safety%20response,evacuate%20students%20to%20another%20site.">objections to cell phone use</a> during emergencies. They can serve as a distraction when used for texting, calling, and even <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/12/01/oxford-michigan-high-school-shooting-video-escape-classroom/8823740002/">livestreaming an emergency</a>, which can <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lifeline-distraction-shooting-reignites-debate-phones-schools-rcna169920">negatively affect situational awareness</a>. They can also <a href="https://cbs12.com/news/cbs12-news-i-team/school-districts-respond-after-i-team-cell-phone-dead-zones-report">attract unwanted attention</a> to the locations of individuals who may be hiding and are frequently <a href="https://www.deseret.com/education/2024/12/17/wisconsin-abundant-life-shooting-do-phones-make-schools-safer/">unreliable</a> as cellular networks can become congested, which can also disrupt communication among first responders. Furthermore, information that students share with parents and peers via texts or calls during a crisis is <a href="https://tarheels.live/carolinanownews/2023/12/06/the-impact-of-misinformation-social-medias-role-in-uncs-school-shooting/">frequently inaccurate</a>, according to Katherine Schweit, the founder of the FBI’s Active Shooter Program, and this can lead to increased confusion and chaos.</p>
<p>It is important to note that these factors are usually considered in relation to <a href="https://rockinst.org/issue-area/2023-can-mass-shootings-be-stopped/">mass school shootings</a>, which, despite being extremely infrequent events, are <a href="https://www.edweek.org/technology/school-shootings-are-fueling-the-debate-over-cellphones-in-class/2022/06">influencing the conversation</a> about cell phone restrictions. When considering a ban or limitations on cell phones and other devices in schools, stakeholders should evaluate how these devices fit into a more comprehensive <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/sj.2015.9?fromPaywallRec=true">multimodal emergency notification system</a> (for example, combining cell phone-based communication through texts and calls with digital signage and/or social media, radio, and television broadcasts) and how they could be most effectively utilized during other types of crises, such as fires, hazardous material incidents, or weather-related events (like tornadoes or earthquakes), and not just in the event of a school shooting.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Likewise, the infrequency of school shootings can be considered alongside the wider effects of cell phones in the school setting when contemplating such bans. Similarly, these considerations can be made in relation to the availability of alternative methods and technologies, such as systems that enable almost immediate communication via text messages and audio calls, and which can be used to send out official, confirmed statements from school authorities to parents in the event of a crisis.</p>
<h5><strong>Final Remarks</strong></h5>
<p>Further research is required to fully grasp the effects of cell phone use during school hours and the effectiveness of cell phone bans, yet initial reports from districts that have enacted these policies are showing <a href="https://www.edweek.org/technology/what-schools-look-like-without-the-cellphone-distraction/2025/02">encouraging outcomes</a>, such as fewer behavioral problems and greater student engagement. These new policies, however, are diverse: they are being enacted at various levels—state, district, or individual school; they limit cell phones either just during class time or for the entire school day with a "bell-to-bell" ban; they are supervised and enforced by teachers, staff, and/or administrators; and they employ a range of methods from telling students to keep their devices in their lockers or backpacks, to daily collection by school personnel, or the use of storage solutions like phone pouches. Policymakers in New York will need to weigh carefully and thoughtfully how to find a balance between the best interests of students, parents, and educators when deciding whether and how to implement a statewide policy. Moreover, as new technologies are brought in—or brought back—to aid communication in the context of cell phone bans, <a href="https://pagersdirect.net/pages/pagers-for-students-are-a-thing-for-the-2024-school-year?srsltid=AfmBOoo85LNzBGlStyQcw_2EsQ3xEu3iPkyzM82BuBiiiPjkwcQ2__dP">as is happening with pagers</a>, policymakers must think about how to adjust their policies to keep up with the constantly evolving technological environment in education.</p>

A classroom management approach can be employed where students contact their parents in small groups at a time to lessen the strain on communication networks.</p>
