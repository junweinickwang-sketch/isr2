            <h1>A Proposed Legislative Framework for Restricting Smartphone Use in K–12 Public Schools</h1>

            <div>
                <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
                <p>Throughout the United States, a general agreement has developed regarding the importance of restricting young people's access to smartphones in educational settings.[1] A Manhattan Institute poll conducted in July 2024 found that 60% of probable voters across the country are deeply or significantly concerned about cellphone usage in schools. Notwithstanding the current polarized political environment, a majority of 73% of voters believe that schools ought to implement measures to curtail access to cellular phones.[2]</p>
                <p>The demographic known as Generation Z, which includes individuals born after 1995 and frequently praised as "digital natives," represents the initial group to mature with continuous technological access. Such proficiency with digital tools was commonly portrayed as an advantage, preparing contemporary youth to traverse the modern landscape effortlessly. However, as social psychologist Jonathan Haidt and other experts have documented recently,[3] this unceasing digital engagement—particularly via social media—presents notable disadvantages. Haidt points out that the daily six to eight hours of screen-centered leisure for teenagers carries a significant opportunity cost, representing time that is not dedicated to interacting with friends, acquiring new abilities, or discovering the tangible world.[4]</p>
                <p>In a recent survey of 1,006 Gen Z adults between the ages of 18 and 27, 60% indicated that they engage with social media for a minimum of four hours per day, while 22% reported spending seven hours or more daily.[5] Nearly half of the respondents expressed a wish that social media services such as TikTok and Snapchat had never been created, revealing the frustration that a large number of young American adults experience with social media.</p>
                <p>Generation Alpha, composed of children born from 2010 onwards and often referred to as “screenagers,” exhibits screen time habits that surpass those of earlier generations, including Gen Z.[6] Approximately 65% of Generation Alpha members use social media for as long as four hours each day, and 58% received their first smartphone before reaching the age of 10.[7] This younger cohort of students has already faced disruptions to their elementary education and social learning due to policies on masking and remote instruction related to Covid-19.[8] A dependency on smartphones is now causing further erosion of their educational skills and social maturation.</p>
                <p>The American public is increasingly acknowledging that a reliance on smartphones can be detrimental to our youngest generation. A growing body of evidence from both personal anecdotes and scientific research indicates a connection between smartphone usage and diminished academic results, increased anxiety, feelings of loneliness, distress, and interference with healthy social development in children. Educators have confirmed that cellphones and smartphones divert students' focus from their academic tasks. A recent Pew Research survey revealed that "72% of high school teachers say students being distracted by their cellphones in the classroom is a major problem."[9]</p>
                <p>Consequently, states, municipalities, and individual school districts throughout the U.S. are reassessing their regulations regarding phone use in public schools. This issue extends beyond partisan, state, and even international boundaries. Both large urban and small rural districts, as well as jurisdictions led by Republicans and Democrats, are starting to seek out effective solutions. The United Nations’ UNESCO agency has gone so far as to advocate for a worldwide prohibition of smartphones in schools.[10]</p>
                <p>This issue brief, along with the model legislation it contains, is designed to offer states a widely applicable policy for restricting smartphone use in public schools. It includes clear and direct enforcement guidelines to assist state and local elected officials and school administrators in limiting smartphone usage in public educational institutions nationwide.</p>

                <h3><strong>The Deleterious Effects of Smartphones in Schools</strong></h3>
                <p>The use of smartphones in schools can negatively affect children in two significant ways at minimum: 1) by creating a distraction from students' educational activities, especially concerning learning and classroom discipline; and 2) by obstructing the development of healthy childhood social skills. These two elements of the in-person academic setting are crucial for a child's growth into a well-adjusted and functional adult. The authority of local education agencies to limit smartphone use is warranted for potentially two reasons linked to these negative impacts. Firstly, public schools have traditionally acted <em>in loco parentis</em>, which means that when parents entrust their minor children to a school, the institution has an obligation to foster the learning and ensure the safety of its students[11]—a responsibility that may be particularly hindered by smartphone use. Secondly, the function of the public education system includes, at least partially,[12] preparing students for meaningful engagement in a democratic society; despite arguments favoring technology use because of its prevalence in the "real world," schools are the main environment where children learn face-to-face interaction, which is still essential for a society to function properly.</p>
                
                <h4><strong>Distracting from the Educational Experience and Impact on Academic Performance</strong></h4>
                <p>Student involvement in their studies declines when they are diverted by smartphones. The process of learning necessitates listening, observing, reading, and active participation. Students who have smartphones accessible use them during class lectures, at times when they should be reading or completing school assignments, and when they are meant to be learning collaboratively in group settings. Even when students are not directly using their phones, their attention can be consumed by the devices' mere existence and availability: they contemplate new text messages, notice vibrations, and are aware of quiet notification sounds. Students experience a powerful urge to check their smartphones with surprising frequency, constantly anticipating their next interaction with the device. According to Bill Woodard, a high school principal in Santa Barbara, "If that phone is pinging in your pocket, it can take you up to 20 minutes to refocus."[13]</p>
                <p>Both data and informal observations corroborate these assertions. Research employing detailed data that monitored mobile phone notifications revealed that teenagers received an average of 237 notifications per day, with approximately 25% of these alerts happening during school hours.[14] In one particular study involving college students, more than 90% admitted to getting texts during class, and 86% acknowledged sending texts to someone from class.[15] A different study indicated that engaging with Facebook or texting while completing schoolwork can overload cognitive processing abilities, which might prevent more profound learning from occurring.[16] The use of and addiction to smartphones have also been linked to reduced sleep quality,[17] and the quality of sleep is significantly correlated with academic achievement.[18]</p>
                <p>Perhaps more directly on point, besides the complex ways screen time might affect the brain and learning, a comprehensive review of studies on smartphone use in schools reveals a substantial amount of evidence indicating a negative correlation with academic results.[19] Multiple researchers have independently concluded that phone use significantly distracts students, with one noting that "cellphone addiction and distractedness played key roles in impacting the effects of condition on test performance"[20] and another stating that "[p]articipants who kept their cellphone performed worse on the quiz for material presented in the 3rd quarter of the lecture than those without cellphones. Distracted participants performed worse on the test for the same material than those who were not distracted.… Findings indicate that having cellphones in a short lecture has its largest impact on attention and learning 10–15 min into the lecture."[21]</p>
                <p>A study that examined the consequences of a cellphone prohibition in Spain discovered that "during the less than three years that the mobile phones ban was in force (from 2015 to 2017), students’ scores in Galicia improved by around 10 points in maths and 12 points in sciences as compared to a synthetic Galicia that had followed exactly the same trend in these scores before the intervention."[22] Schools in the United States that have effectively limited smartphone use have noted positive outcomes, including better standardized test results, improved grades, enhanced interpersonal communications, and even greater attendance at school athletic events.[23]</p>
                <p>It is important to note that teachers possess progressively fewer options for managing classroom conduct, due to recent changes in school discipline policies[24] and the increasing prevalence of therapeutic approaches in educational settings.[25] For instance, teachers' unions have generally endorsed measures that reduce the penalties for misbehavior, such as substituting disciplinary codes with "restorative justice" methods.[26] Smartphones introduce difficulties in upholding school behavior rules and preserving order within the classroom. The challenges faced by teachers are a significant issue, as classroom conduct has worsened[27] and a growing number of educators are departing from the profession.[28] Teachers who are tasked with enforcing a smartphone policy at the classroom level bear this extra responsibility, and they frequently express a desire for the school district to establish a consistent, overarching policy instead.[29]</p>

                <h4><strong>Corrosive Effects on Social Development and Well-Being</strong></h4>
                <p>The use of smartphones in schools also causes harm to children by inhibiting their social growth and overall well-being. This harm manifests in several ways. Initially, children who are preoccupied with their phones engage in fewer simultaneous interactions with their peers. It is common for children to sit together quietly while they browse on their phones at school, rather than engaging in conversation and mutual learning. During recess, they also tend to choose phone use over play, even though there is extensive evidence that children require numerous chances for play, which is essential for healthy brain maturation and social competence.[30]</p>
                <p>The extent to which the diminished frequency of these social interactions endangers healthy childhood growth is difficult to exaggerate. Haidt posits that the sole credible explanation for the global decrease in adolescent mental health over the past 15 years "is the sudden and massive change in the technology that teens were using to connect with each other."[31] Additional research indicates that children with underlying social anxiety might prefer digital communication over face-to-face interactions: "opting to substitute digital media for interpersonal communication to avoid feared situations may become cyclically reinforced over time, making the person even more avoidant and worsening the symptoms and severity of social anxiety disorder."[32]</p>
                <p>Research has also indicated that "[b]y banning smartphones, students communicate and socially interact directly with each other more often. This promotes the development of social skills and strengthens the community within the school." In a related finding, cellphone prohibitions can lead to "positive effects on satisfaction, conflicts, and competition."[33] Indeed, engaging in proactive, in-person social activities instead of spending excessive time on social media can be a successful strategy for helping students overcome social anxiety.[34] Studies involving reduced exposure to social media typically reveal enhancements in anxiety and depression levels.[35]</p>
                <p>Secondly, the specific content that children excessively consume on applications such as Instagram or TikTok has been demonstrated to heighten anxiety and depression, particularly among girls.[36] The use of social media shows a strong correlation with these mental health issues.[37] Young adults are especially prone to experiencing feelings of envy and unhappiness with their own lives when they are exposed to social media.[38]</p>
                <p>The excessive use of cellular and smartphones has also been associated with increased incidents of cyberbullying, where students act as both aggressors and targets in these situations due to their continuous link to social media and messaging services.[39] A 2017 study found that students who possessed cellphones had a higher likelihood of either being a victim of bullying or being bullies themselves.[40] A climate of irresponsible digital conduct fosters a culture that undermines the importance of privacy and encourages the careless sharing of personal details (such as "doxxing"), which in turn intensifies bullying and victimization.[41]</p>
                <p>Thirdly, the regular use of phones during school hours elevates the chances of sexting, with some students being unaware of the legal, emotional, or academic repercussions that are involved.[42]</p>

                <h3><strong>Emerging Approaches to Cell and Smartphone Bans</strong></h3>
                <p>A full 77% of public school students across the nation are already enrolled in a school that has some form of restriction on cell or smartphone use for non-educational purposes.[43] The majority of teachers are in favor of restrictions or outright bans on smartphones. Across the country, 90% of teachers who are members of the National Education Association union endorse policies that forbid cellphone use during class time, and 83% support extending this prohibition to cover the entire school day.[44] An article published by the NEA revealed that numerous teachers desired clear policies and direction from their school districts, yet many school administrators shirked the duty of establishing consistent regulations.</p>
                <p>Within New York State, 60% of the electorate is in favor of prohibiting smartphones within classrooms.[45] New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, has indicated her support for a "bell to bell" (from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.) ban on the use of personal internet-enabled devices in public schools.[46] In May 2024, Hochul stated that education officials "have to liberate" public school students from the anxiety of missing out on what others might be saying about them and the perceived obligation to reply to their smartphone alerts.[47] Similarly, for several months, Mayor Eric Adams and the New York City Department of Education have been contemplating a smartphone ban, although they have not yet succeeded in enacting a policy for the entire city.[48]</p>
                <p>Among teachers in New York City's public schools, 63% are in favor of a ban across the city.[49] However, the specifics of how to design and enforce such a policy have been delegated to individual schools, leading to a lack of uniformity and a slow beginning for a citywide initiative.[50] While 38% of teachers in schools that have already put bans in place report them as successful—suggesting that such bans can be effective—a larger portion (40%) described the bans as failures.[51] Those who deemed their school's ban a failure most commonly pointed to insufficient planning and organization as the cause. Among educators in schools with an existing ban, 70% were in favor of implementing a citywide prohibition.[52]</p>
                <p>Michael Mulgrew, who serves as the president of the influential city teachers' union, has stated that any policy implemented citywide should integrate the successful strategies from schools that have already established restrictions.[53] A union press release indicated that educators found "in middle and high schools, collecting phones as students walked into the school building worked the best," while for elementary schools, the most effective method was to have phones kept inside backpacks and powered off.[54] Both of these recommended practices involved removing the phones from the students' possession.</p>
                <p>Various states have begun to adopt a range of strategies to manage smartphone use in schools. These strategies differ in both their intensity (the extent to which students can use their devices during the school day) and their level of detail (the degree of autonomy given to or taken from individual schools). The fact that so many schools are facing issues with smartphones indicates that these policies are frequently not working, due to either flawed design, poor execution, or a combination of both.</p>
                <p>Legislators at the state, city, or individual school level who want to prohibit smartphone use in schools need to take into account multiple elements, such as access during the time between classes, options for phone storage, and methods for enforcement. For instance, should students be permitted to use their devices during their lunch breaks or as they move between classes? School leaders also need to establish a system for consequences when students do not follow the set rules. Lastly, they must make provisions for essential or beneficial flexibility and exceptions to the policy, which will differ depending on the specific characteristics of the students and the local area.</p>

                <h4><strong>School- and District-Level Approaches</strong></h4>
                <p>Inadequate enforcement stands as the primary obstacle to the success of a smartphone policy. Educators frequently find the task of enforcing these rules to be challenging, uncomfortable, or even hazardous.[55] Due to inconsistent enforcement, students frequently disregard the regulations. A study that examined the smartphone data of 200 students aged 11–17 revealed that 97% of them used their phones during the school day, for a median duration of 43 minutes.[56] A report from the Fordham Institute highlights: "Without consistent enforcement, none of these cellphone policies mean anything. I had many exchanges with current and former teachers. When I asked them which policy they preferred, by far the most common answer was ‘the one that will be enforced.’ "[57] Numerous case studies and examples consistently affirm the importance of having unambiguous rules and uniform expectations for enforcement.</p>
                <p>In Orange County, Florida, which encompasses Orlando, before the implementation of a district-wide smartphone prohibition, students "rarely looked up from their devices as they walked down school hallways."[58] A number of students posted pictures and videos of their peers on social media, which led to instances of bullying. The district went beyond Florida's statewide mandate by forbidding students from using cellphones for the entire school day, which included the periods between classes. The outcomes were notable: "on the first day the ban took effect, Timber Creek administrators confiscated more than 100 phones from students," but then, as students understood the ban would be upheld and ceased using their phones, the number of confiscations decreased rapidly.[59]</p>
                <p>At a high school located in Beaverton, Oregon, teachers were initially advised to use signs indicating "tech OK / tech away," but the majority just instructed students to store their phones when it was deemed necessary.[60] In reality, the policy ended up reflecting the personal preferences of each teacher. The consequence was that students frequently took out their smartphones to answer text messages, doing so either covertly or openly.</p>
                <p>In contrast, Marist Catholic High School in Eugene, Oregon, adopted a more rigorous policy, mandating that students place their phones into cubbyholes supplied by the school during all classes and school assemblies.[61] Any breach of this rule results in the confiscation of the phone and academic consequences. The students recognize the significance of this enforcement. As one sophomore stated: "The stricter the teacher, the less missing phones from the cubby."</p>
                <p>Prior to the 2024–25 academic year, teachers in Santa Barbara, California, had the authority to set their own classroom's smartphone rules. Similar to the situation in Beaverton, this approach was found to be ineffective, since the majority of teachers failed to implement a smartphone management strategy. In reaction, a representative from the Santa Barbara teachers' union polled its members on their opinions, shared the results with the district, and successfully advocated for a new, district-wide "Off and Away" policy.[62] According to this policy, students are required to store their phones in a designated "phone hotel" within each classroom, although they are permitted to use them after class and during break times.</p>
                <p>The implementation of a consistent policy assisted Santa Barbara teachers in enforcing the rule uniformly. As Devon Espejo, an art teacher who had formerly mandated that phones be stored on a numbered shelf, commented, "A more uniform approach will help us control these devices in the classroom."[63] It is now expected that every teacher throughout the school system will enforce the policy, which eliminates variations in strictness and lessens the potential for disagreements, both of which can diminish the policy's effectiveness.[64] As high school Spanish instructor Esther Limon noted about the district-wide regulation, "everyone knows it’s an expectation now."[65]</p>
                <p>The public schools in Scarsdale, New York, have also implemented an "off and away" rule that is adjusted according to the school level. Students in elementary school are advised against bringing smartphones to school at all, but if they must, the phones must be powered off and stored in their backpacks.[66] At the middle school within the district, phones are required to be turned off and kept in lockers. In the district's high school, students are instructed to put their phones into a caddy located at the entrance of every classroom before the class starts, and they can take them back at the conclusion of the class period. A high school English teacher, Jennifer Rosenzweig, who was involved in creating the district's smartphone rule, states that the phone caddies "make a difference but not enough," and she further notes that "each student needs seven hours a day without pings and buzzes calling out to them."[67] Rosenzweig argues that students who are permitted to check their phones between classes are less able to retain the information taught in class. She believes they instead "need down time between classes to absorb the information just taught, and if they look at a screen, that information is immediately lost." In a collaborative panel of students and teachers assigned to update the district policy, the members overwhelmingly called for a "more unified effort to keep phones off and away."[68]</p>
                <p>Specialized pouches, like the Yondr brand which uses a magnetic locking system, have not always been completely successful.[69] Allowing students to keep their phones turned on and in their possession, even when magnetically secured, can still be a source of distraction as they can feel notification vibrations and be curious about who is trying to contact them. Resourceful students at certain schools have discovered methods to bypass the magnetic lock, such as by striking it with enough force, or by feigning that their phone is secured within the pouch.[70] In essence, no technology can replace the need for well-defined policies and unwavering enforcement.</p>

                <h4><strong>State Approaches</strong></h4>
                <p>On the more directive end of the spectrum, four states have prohibited smartphones or cellphones in classrooms (Indiana, Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana), and in another state (New Hampshire), the governor has declared an intention to implement a ban:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indiana mandates that "[e]ach school corporation and charter school shall adopt and implement a wireless communication device policy that … prohibits a student from using a wireless communication device during instructional time, [but] authorizes a teacher to allow a student to use a wireless communication device for educational purposes during instructional time."[71]</li>
                    <li>Florida's regulation specifies that "a student may not use a wireless communications device during instructional time, except when expressly directed by a teacher solely for educational purposes. A teacher shall designate an area for wireless communications devices during instructional time."[72]</li>
                    <li>The law in South Carolina provides that: "During the school day, students are prohibited from accessing their personal electronic devices, unless authorized for classroom use. Students may not wear or access device accessories during the school day. Students must store their devices and device accessories in lockers, backpacks, or otherwise as directed by the school district during the school day. Districts may forbid student possession of devices and device accessories on school property."[73]</li>
                    <li>Louisiana's prohibition on the possession and use of these devices declares that "no student shall possess, on his person, an electronic telecommunication device throughout the instructional day. If a student brings an electronic telecommunication device in any public elementary or secondary school building or on the grounds thereof during an instructional day, the electronic device shall either be turned off and properly stowed away for the duration of the instructional day or prohibited from being turned on and used during the instructional day."[74]</li>
                    <li>On the 9th of January, Kelly Ayotte, the recently sworn-in governor of New Hampshire, stated that the state would proceed with a ban on cell phones in schools.[75]</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Additional states, including Minnesota and Ohio, have undertaken actions that do not constitute a complete prohibition but have directed school districts to create their own policies on phone usage. In Iowa, a ban is under consideration but remains in the preliminary phases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Minnesota's requirement is that each "school district or charter school must adopt a policy on students’ possession and use of cellphones in school by March 15, 2025. The Minnesota Elementary School Principals Association and the Minnesota Association of Secondary School Principals must collaborate to make best practices available to schools,"[76] thus allowing each school district the autonomy to formulate a policy to curtail smartphone use.</li>
                    <li>Ohio has similarly enacted legislation that mandates, by July 1, 2025, "each school district board of education shall adopt a policy governing the use of cellular telephones by students during school hours."[77]</li>
                    <li>In the latter part of November, Iowa's Governor Kim Reynolds declared her intention to introduce legislation that would prohibit smartphones in public schools across the state, although she deferred providing specific details to a later time.[78]</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>
                <p>Due to the negative influence on social interaction and classroom instruction, as well as the potential harm to healthy childhood socialization, it is recommended that states, cities, and school districts impose stringent limitations on the use of smartphones on school property for the entirety of the school day and during any other school-organized events. This recommendation is consistent with both scientific findings and practical evidence, which show that smartphone use in schools diverts students from the social engagement and academic duties that are vital for their proper development. It is also in line with Haidt's suggestion for a school day that is entirely free of phones.[79]</p>
                <p>As the experiences of numerous districts and schools have shown, for such a policy to be successful, it needs to be explicitly defined and consistently applied. Consequently, our proposed policy suggests, fundamentally, that no smartphones should be visible on school premises during school operational hours or at school-sponsored functions. Since school hours can differ among districts or individual schools, we suggest consulting the school's handbook to determine the specific times when phone access will be limited. School districts should mandate that students either place their smartphones in a locker or another secure storage facility, hand over their devices to a school official for safekeeping upon entering the school, or ensure their phones are turned off and kept in their backpacks for the whole school day. Students who have stored their phones can get them back at the end of the school day, which guarantees a learning environment free from phone distractions. The ideal scenario would be for districts to mandate locker-based storage, but due to resource constraints and a desire to accommodate local choices, we are including a strict "Off and Away" alternative, where phones must be powered down and stored in students' backpacks throughout the entire school day.</p>
                <p>For a prohibition to have any effective means of deterrence, it must be applied uniformly by both teachers and staff. The clear-cut rule we propose enables school personnel who see students using smartphones to quickly and simply identify the use as forbidden and to apply the regulations. The policy also puts forward a sample framework for penalties that escalate in harshness with each instance a student is found with a smartphone. We have incorporated several stages in the disciplinary framework to show the variety of measures available to states and school districts, which become more severe with subsequent infractions. Our policy would also offer low-cost incentives to students and schools for adhering to the rules. Lastly, the policy includes provisions for enforcement at both the school and district levels through reporting to the state superintendent of education's office, which establishes a supervisory mechanism through state-level education authorities.</p>

                <h3><strong>Addressing Concerns</strong></h3>
                <p>Parents and advocates for education have concerns about cellphone bans that are well-meaning and understandable. These worries are mostly centered around safety, digital proficiency, and medical needs. Parents express anxiety that a ban on smartphones would hinder their ability to contact their child during an emergency, such as a natural disaster or a situation involving an active threat. Some parents have stated that phone bans "cut off a lifeline parents have to make sure their children are safe during school shootings or other emergencies."[80] Although schools are equipped with landline telephones and other communication methods for students and teachers in emergencies, a large number of parents would still rather their children have a device for immediate communication if it becomes necessary.</p>
                <p>However, law enforcement and school safety professionals argue that phones can actually compromise student safety, emphasizing the need for students to give their complete focus to adult instructions when immediate action is required; a matter of seconds can be critical in saving their lives.[81] In reaction to parents who were distressed by a New York City school's delay in notifying them about a school safety concern that was later found to be baseless, Governor Hochul emphasized that smartphones can be a distraction for students when there is an immediate threat.[82]</p>
                <p>While mass shootings at schools receive extensive media coverage, they are still infrequent events.[83] Using this as a reason to avoid implementing sensible restrictions on smartphones in schools conveys an incorrect signal to students and parents that a high level of fear is justified, which can in turn heighten student anxiety and also runs the risk of making extreme behavior seem more common than it is.</p>
                <p>In any event, our proposed language resolves these issues by prohibiting smartphones, but not basic cellphones that only have calling functions. As specified in the policy, a "basic phone" is a portable cellular radiotelephone or electronic gadget that cannot install applications from third-party sources other than those pre-loaded by the maker, and that cannot access social media platforms through websites or apps. Schools would still have the power to control the use of basic phones, for instance, by mandating that they be kept silent during classes. Our policy also allows for wearable electronic items like smartwatches, as parents might choose to monitor their children's whereabouts with such devices, possibly as an alternative to providing them with a Basic Phone.</p>
                <p>A final frequent worry regarding smartphone prohibitions is that they might hinder children from gaining sufficient familiarity with technology to use it effectively in their future careers and social interactions. Some have expressed apprehension that students may find it challenging to adjust to a workforce that is heavily reliant on technology.[84] Regarding digital skills, as previously mentioned, a deficiency in technological competence is not a clear issue among young people, whereas many children find face-to-face communication difficult.[85] If digital literacy is a priority, further effort is needed to define what specifically qualifies as "responsible" use of smartphones and social media—criteria that are not as straightforward as they might initially seem. Creating effective and pertinent digital literacy courses will present an entirely new set of challenges. Although the implementation of digital literacy initiatives is on the rise, there is still no agreement on the core themes of digital literacy, and the success of these programs remains unproven.[86] Considering the rapid pace of technological advancement, mandating digital literacy programs could compel schools to create educational materials that may become obsolete before they can be widely implemented.</p>
                <p>Our model does not prohibit schools from teaching students how to use smartphones, computers, or other forms of technology. In pre-arranged, designated, and supervised environments, students can still be permitted to use such electronic devices; for example, in clear-cut situations like popular computer-aided design (CAD) classes, courses in computer science and technology, or in associated after-school activities and clubs, such as those for robotics, computer programming, and coding.</p>
                <p>Regarding medical issues, these concerns can be managed through alternative arrangements and suitable accommodations. Students with health conditions, like diabetes, frequently use their phones to oversee those conditions. The American Diabetes Association, for instance, views smartphones as being "paramount to the student’s ongoing diabetes care, health, and safety," allowing students with diabetes to use their device to "monitor their blood glucose (blood sugar) levels, administer insulin, and share data with school nurses, trained school staff, and other caregivers."[87]</p>
                <p>Our proposed legislation includes sufficient provisions for students with medical needs. Section 7(b) of the legislation outlines a procedure for getting a medical exemption following "the submission of a formal written request by the student’s parent or guardian, accompanied by a verified letter from a licensed physician." The policy then generally adheres to the medical exemption procedure established under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which is a requirement for all school districts under federal law.</p>
                <p>The strictness of the suggested exemption procedure is intended to discourage requests for conditions that do not necessitate an exception. Instead, the school can offer a reasonable accommodation, short of permitting smartphone possession throughout the day, such as designated times during the day when students can check their phones. For cases where no suitable alternative device or accommodation is available, students will be given an exception.</p>

                <h4><strong>Section 4: Allowable Devices</strong></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>No part of this policy document should be interpreted as a denial of:
                        <ol>
                            <li>A student's ability to use a Basic Phone for communicating with parents or guardians. The use of such devices will be permitted before and after School Hours, or in emergency situations, as decided by the school principal;</li>

                <h4><strong>Section 5: Enforcement</strong></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Every school is required to appoint one or more members of the School Staff to be in charge of enforcing the rules of this policy document.</li>
                    <li>When a student is found to have broken this policy, School Staff must immediately inform a designated staff member responsible for administering this policy, who will then record the infraction in the school's official records and apply any relevant penalty.
                        <ol>
                            <li>School staff members who report an infraction or enforce a rule of this policy document will be protected from any form of harassment, retaliation, coercion, or intimidation for adhering to this policy.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Each school district is required to establish a consistent disciplinary policy for both initial and subsequent violations of this policy document that occur within the same academic year.
                        <ol>
                            <li>The severity of consequences for repeated violations will escalate and may, at the school district's discretion, lead to the most serious disciplinary measure permitted by the district's code of conduct or policy.</li>
                            <li>As a baseline, every school district must implement the following disciplinary measures for violations and repeated violations of this policy document within a single school year:*
                                <ol>
                                    <li>For the initial violation, a member of the School Staff will issue a verbal warning to the student, stating that Smartphone use is forbidden during the school day, and will notify the student that the incident will be documented in the school's records.</li>
                                    <li>For the second violation, the student must hand over the Smartphone to a member of the School Staff, who will immediately place it in a Smartphone Storage Rack or another secure place. The student must then go to the principal's office at the conclusion of School Hours, where a staff member will confirm that the violation has been recorded and will return the Smartphone to the student.</li>
                                    <li>For the third violation, the student must surrender the Smartphone to a member of the School Staff, who will secure it in a Smartphone Storage Rack or another safe location until the student can retrieve it at the end of School Hours. By the day after the violation at the latest, a formal letter from a School Staff member must be given to both the student and their parent or guardian. This letter will detail the requirements of the school district's Smartphone policy and provide a warning about the consequences of any further non-compliance. The student and their parent or guardian must sign a statement acknowledging these consequences and committing to follow the school district's Smartphone policy.</li>
                                    <li>For the fourth violation, the student will be obligated to give their Smartphone to a member of the School Staff, who will then secure it in a Smartphone Storage Rack or another safe place until it is picked up by the student's parent or guardian.</li>
                                    <li>For the fifth violation, the student must give their Smartphone to a member of the School Staff, who will secure it in a Smartphone Storage Rack or another safe place until a parent or guardian retrieves it. Upon retrieval, a School Staff member and a school counselor will have a meeting with the student and their parent or guardian, or arrange for such a meeting within the following seven calendar days, to review the circumstances of the student's violations to date and to discuss the consequences of any future non-compliance.</li>
                                    <li>For the sixth violation, and for any additional violations, the student will be suspended for a duration of [X] days, in accordance with the school district's suspension policy. The principal is required to provide a signed letter to both the student and their parent or guardian, which will detail the conditions of the suspension and the repercussions of any future failure to comply.</li>
                                    <li>Following a maximum of three in-school suspensions, the student will be assigned an out-of-school suspension. After a maximum of three out-of-school suspensions, the school is authorized to apply the most severe penalty allowed under the school district's disciplinary code or policy.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <hr>
                <p>*This graduated discipline policy is designed to offer a practical and logical framework for implementing a spectrum of disciplinary responses. School districts have the flexibility to adjust this minimum standard based on their specific needs, such as by streamlining the number of steps (but not by adding more to be more lenient), altering the penalties for violations, or imposing consequences for Smartphone use that leads to issues like cyberbullying or physical altercations.</p>

                <h4><strong>Section 6: Implementation</strong></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Every school is required to:
                        <ol>
                            <li>At the conclusion of each academic year, and no later than June 30th,* compile an annual report detailing the number of violations of this policy document that took place during the preceding school year, which must include the count of disciplined students, the total number of violations, and how often each type of penalty was administered.</li>
                            <li>Within one week of the school year's start, or within one week of a student's enrollment in a district school, make sure that the school district's Smartphone policy, which includes the list of approved Basic Phones for use on School Grounds as per Section 4(b), is provided in both printed and digital formats to every student and their parent or guardian.</li>
                            <li>Within five business days of receiving the school district's Smartphone policy, ensure that every student and their parent have signed and submitted an acknowledgment, either in print or electronically, confirming their understanding and acceptance of the school district's Smartphone policy.</li>
                            <li>By the beginning of each school year at the latest, display the school district's most current Smartphone policy on the school's website in a location that is easy to find.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>By July 30th of every year, each school district must compile an annual report of violations of this policy document that happened during the previous school year within the district. By August 5th of every year, each school district must send this report to the office of the state superintendent of education.</li>
                    <li>In the year after the release of the feasibility study mandated by Section 6(f), and by August 30th of each year for the next three years, the office of the state superintendent of education will publish on its website, in a readily accessible place, summary data showing the average and median number of Smartphone policy violations as a percentage of students across the state, in the school district with the highest rate of violations, and in the school district with the lowest rate of violations.
                        <ol>
                            <li>The top 10 percent of school districts and schools in the state, respectively, that have the lowest number of Smartphone policy violations relative to their student population will be awarded a certificate bearing the signature, or a facsimile signature, of the governor and the state superintendent of education for their outstanding compliance with the Smartphone policy.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Annually, the office of the state superintendent of education will examine the reports from every school district, offer extra assistance, and implement corrective measures as needed for school districts and schools that the superintendent determines have an unacceptably high rate of Smartphone policy violations.</li>
                    <li>Every school district must create a policy to offer incentives for students who have followed the rules of this policy document. This incentives program must also include rewards for grade-level and school-wide adherence. At a minimum, it shall:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Provide a reward to students, grade levels, and schools that have maintained compliance for a full school year, according to the terms of the rewards program;</li>
                            <li>Grant a certificate or another form of tangible acknowledgment to students who have had no violations of this policy document for an entire school year, recognizing their perfect compliance; and</li>
                            <li>Adopt the suggestions from the feasibility study by the state superintendent of education, as mandated under Section 6(f) of this policy document.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>No later than the beginning of the school year that follows the enactment of this policy document, the state superintendent of education is required to conduct a feasibility study that explores a variety of rewards for school districts and schools that have demonstrated high levels of adherence to this policy. This study must assess the resources on hand for providing rewards and suggest further funding and other incentives for school districts that implement a policy mandating the restrictions found in Sections 3(d)(1) or (3)(d)(2).</li>
                    <li>Within three months of the feasibility study's publication as required by Section 6(f), the state superintendent of education must establish a rewards and incentives program, based on the study's conclusions, for school districts that enact a policy enforcing the limitations in Sections 3(d)(1) or (3)(d)(2), and for those that have shown high rates of compliance with this policy document.</li>
                    <li>This policy document will become effective in [X] months, or at the beginning of the next school year after its passage, whichever date is later.</li>
                </ol>
                <hr>

                <h4><strong>Section 7: Exceptions for Medical Conditions</strong></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>All requests for Medical Exceptions to this policy document will be handled according to the school district's established policy, procedure, and committee for evaluating applications for reasonable accommodations as stipulated by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</li>
                    <li>Insofar as it is allowed by state and federal regulations, a Medical Exception to some or all of the provisions of this policy document or a school district's Smartphone policy can be approved only after a formal written request is submitted by the student's parent or guardian, which must be supported by a letter from a licensed physician.</li>
                    <li>To the degree allowed by state and federal law, any requests for a Medical Exception will be rejected if a suitable accommodation can be provided to address the student's medical requirements without permitting access to a Smartphone.</li>
                    <li>In cases where no appropriate reasonable accommodation or substitute for Smartphone use is found, the Medical Exception will be approved.</li>
                    <li>The evaluation of applications for Medical Exceptions must be finished within the same timeframe as that allowed for applications for reasonable accommodations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</li>
                    <li>Any decisions made can be appealed to the same degree as decisions that are made under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4><strong>Section 8: Severability</strong></h4>
                <p>The clauses of this policy document are officially stated to be separable. If any clause of this policy document, or the way it is applied to any individual or situation, is found or declared to be invalid for any reason, that declaration or finding will not impact the validity of the other parts of this policy document or the application of its clauses to any other individuals or situations.</p>
