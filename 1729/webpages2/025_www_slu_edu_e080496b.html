         <p><em>An expert analysis by Ashley Donaldson Burle, Ph.D., was published on March 18, 2025.</em></p>
         <p>Dr. Ashley Donaldson Burle of Saint Louis University offers an expert analysis concerning the findings from the February 2025 SLU/YouGov Poll.</p>
         <p>On average, teenagers are subjected to a median of 273 cell phone notifications daily, with almost one-quarter of these alerts arriving during school hours. A recommendation from the International Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) proposed that a complete prohibition on cell phones is the most effective method to remove distractions from the school environment. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, 77% of public schools currently forbid student cell phone use during any class period. This policy is more prevalent in elementary schools, with 86% implementing a ban, in contrast to 55% of secondary and high schools. Despite these policies, the use of phones in schools remains widespread, and the enforcement of rules is often inconsistent, varying even between different classrooms.</p>
         <p>Advocates for cell phone bans contend that such policies can help alleviate concerns about youth mental health and reduce distractions from academic learning. A significant 53% of school administrators have reported that cell phone usage negatively affects academic performance, while over 73% believe phones have an adverse effect on the attention spans of students. Conversely, opponents of these bans assert that phones are essential safety devices during emergencies, such as a school shooting. In fact, 78% of parents have expressed a desire for their children to have access to a cell phone specifically for emergency situations.</p>
         <p>Currently, a minimum of 19 states have enacted laws or policies that either prohibit or limit the use of cellphones in schools, or they advise local districts to create their own regulations. This year, at least sixteen more states have put forth statewide legislation intended to achieve comparable results. The state of Missouri is presently evaluating legislation regarding cell phone bans, including bills like HB 306, HB 854, and SB 68. In February, Governor Mike Kehoe signaled his approval for such a ban by officially endorsing Senate Bill 68.</p>
         <p>Findings from the February 2025 SLU/YouGov Poll revealed that a majority of likely voters, at least 70%, are in favor of preventing students from using their cell phones during standard instructional time across all K-12 grade levels, including elementary, middle, and high schools. Data from a previous poll in August 2024 showed a comparable level of agreement, as 72% of likely voters supported a ban on high school students accessing their cell phones during the school day.</p>

            <figcaption class="caption">A survey of likely Missouri voters asked if they favor or oppose public schools prohibiting student cell phone access during instruction unless approved by the principal. The results showed strong favor for the policy: Elementary schools (76% Favor, 20% Oppose, 5% Not sure), Middle schools (75% Favor, 20% Oppose, 5% Not sure), and High schools (70% Favor, 22% Oppose, 7% Not sure).</figcaption>
         </figure>
         
         <p>Significant variations in opinion on cell phone bans were observed across different age groups of likely voters. Among voters aged 18-29, support for bans in elementary and middle schools stood at 57%. In contrast, voters aged 30 and above showed much stronger support for these bans, with at least 73% favoring them in elementary schools and at least 72% in middle schools. For high schools, a plurality of voters aged 18-29, specifically 49%, supported a ban, while 40% were opposed. This contrasts with voters aged 30 and older, where at least 64% were in favor of high school cell phone bans, with opposition at 25% or lower. These findings collectively suggest that younger voters hold more divided views regarding cell phone prohibitions for high school students.</p>
         <p>The conclusions from the February 2025 SLU/YouGov Poll regarding cell phone bans are consistent with findings on a national level. A national YouGov survey revealed that 58% of adults in the U.S. endorsed a smartphone policy for high schoolers that would forbid their use within the school. In a similar vein, research from the Pew Research Center indicates that 53% of American adults favor a ban on cellphone use by middle and high school students for the entire school day. Furthermore, the National Education Association (NEA) reported that 83% of its members back a policy that would prohibit the use of cellphones or personal devices throughout the whole school day.</p>
         
         <h2>Public Opinion on Social Media Access in Schools</h2>
         <p>A recommendation from the U.S. Surgeon General suggests that social media platforms should include a warning label about their association with significant mental health risks for adolescents. Research has linked frequent use of social media to negative mental health effects in teenagers, such as ongoing feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and an increased risk of suicide. Additionally, social media engagement has been positively correlated with issues like body image concerns, disordered eating, cyberbullying, and other forms of online conflict.</p>
         <p>The use of social media is nearly universal among teenagers. An estimated 95% of young people between the ages of 13 and 17 utilize at least one social media platform, and over a third of them report using it almost constantly. Furthermore, close to 40% of children aged 8 to 12 are active on social media, even though the typical minimum age requirement for these platforms is 13.</p>
         <p>According to the February 2025 SLU/YouGov Poll, a significant majority of likely Missouri voters, at least 81%, support a policy for public schools to block student access to social media via the school's internet. This restriction would apply to all K-12 levels (elementary, middle, and high school), with an exception for when a teacher directs its use for educational reasons. This viewpoint received broad support among all demographics of likely voters, including 76% of younger voters aged 18-29 who also favored such social media bans.</p>

            <figcaption class="caption">A poll of likely Missouri voters measured opinions on whether public schools should block social media on school internet, unless for teacher-instructed educational use. Support for the ban was overwhelming across all school levels: Elementary schools (84% Favor, 13% Oppose, 3% Not sure), Middle schools (83% Favor, 13% Oppose, 4% Not sure), and High schools (81% Favor, 14% Oppose, 5% Not sure).</figcaption>
         </figure>
         
         <p>Although Missourians support bans on social media in schools, they also expressed strong backing for educating students on the topic. The same February 2025 SLU/YouGov Poll revealed that 76% of likely voters advocate for requiring Missouri's public schools to instruct students on the purpose and appropriate use of social media. Furthermore, an even larger majority, 86% of likely voters, believe schools should be required to teach about the negative impacts of social media on mental health. Both of these educational measures received high levels of support from likely voters across all demographics, backgrounds, and political affiliations.</p>

            <figcaption class="caption">Support was even stronger for teaching about social media's negative mental health effects, with 86% of all likely voters in favor.

         </figure>
         
         <p>In addition, likely voters strongly support the requirement for Missouri public schools to teach students how to recognize online misinformation. The February 2025 SLU/YouGov Poll showed that 86% of likely voters are in favor of this educational requirement. This policy was overwhelmingly supported across all subgroups of likely voters. The importance of this finding is highlighted by research showing that teenagers are particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading online misinformation.</p>
         
         <h2>Policy Conclusions and Recommendations for Missouri</h2>
         <p>The findings from the February 2025 SLU/YouGov poll clearly show that Missouri citizens support prohibiting the use of both cell phones and social media within schools. At the same time, they also endorse the implementation of student education focused on social media. As the state of Missouri moves forward with considering new legislation, it is advisable to examine other states for models of successful policy implementation.</p>
         <p>As an example, the state of Florida's phone ban not only forbids cell phone use during instructional time but also blocks social media access on all devices connected to the district's Wi-Fi. The Florida policy also mandates digital literacy instruction starting in the sixth grade to help students develop responsible online behaviors. In another approach, Arkansas implemented a gradual rollout, initially introducing a "Phone-Free School, Mental Health Pilot Program" prior to establishing statewide regulations to curtail student cell phone usage in schools.</p>
         <p>Through the analysis of these and other state-level examples, Missouri has the opportunity to formulate a comprehensive strategy that effectively balances restrictive measures with educational initiatives. It is crucial that any legislation put forward contains unambiguous implementation plans, consistent methods for enforcement, and adequate resources to guarantee that schools can successfully adopt and maintain these new policies over the long term.</p>
