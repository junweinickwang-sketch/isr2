            <section>
                <p>In an age where digital connection is omnipresent, the function of cellphones within school environments has ignited a substantial debate over whether high schools should prohibit their use in classrooms, hallways, and cafeterias.</p>
                <p>Although mobile devices can function as important instruments for education and communication, their extensive utilization by teenagers during school has led to growing concerns regarding distractions and mental well-being nationwide, including here on the South Fork.</p>
                <p>A policy prohibiting cellphone use during school hours was enacted by the Sag Harbor School District in 2023. The regulation mandates that students' phones be secured in personal pouches that necessitate a special magnetic key, accessible only to teachers and administrative staff, for unlocking.</p>
                <p>Jeff Nichols, the superintendent for the district, reported last week that since the policy was put into effect, students have demonstrated greater engagement and concentration in their classes, and there has been a tangible decrease in disciplinary incidents related to cellphones.</p>
                <p>He commented, “Within the cafeteria, one can now observe students conversing and forming social connections, as opposed to being absorbed by their phones.”</p>
                <p>He additionally observed a decrease in bullying linked to social media, resulting in a student body that is more present and under less pressure. Mr. Nichols stated that even with initial opposition from the students, a significant number have since acknowledged the advantages of the policy.</p>
                <p>Sara Bean, an incoming senior at Pierson High School, is among those students. She confirmed that she has witnessed the policy's effects, pointing to a reduction in bullying along with better social interactions, academic performance, and mental wellness among her classmates.</p>
                <p>“While the policy was initially daunting because of my habitual phone usage, I now depend less on my device after school, and my screen time has seen a remarkable reduction,” she stated.</p>
                <p>By comparison, East Hampton High School presently permits smartphones but requires that students deposit them into the pockets of traditional shoe holders hung on classroom doors throughout their lessons. The school's principal, Sara Smith, has endorsed this strategy, referencing the productive potential of phones and the necessity for students to remain accessible to their families in case of emergencies.</p>
                <p>“In our modern era of perpetual communication, I anticipate that a complete prohibition would be problematic,” Ms. Smith communicated via email.</p>
                <p>She did, however, state her awareness of research detailing the adverse effects of cellphones on the mental health of students, and mentioned the school is endeavoring to apply more significant cellphone restrictions. A survey of parents and teachers is being conducted by her to ascertain the impact of phones on students and to devise methods for eradicating the daily disruptions they can cause, which are frequently related to social media.</p>
                <p>“A portion of the student population is more vulnerable to mental health difficulties stemming from cellphone and social media usage, while another portion can utilize a cellphone and preserve their overall well-being,” Ms. Smith remarked.</p>
                <p>An upcoming senior at East Hampton High School, Samantha Ruano, mentioned that she finds her phone valuable for maintaining connections with friends and relatives during school hours. She appreciates receiving texts from friends enrolled in the same courses during earlier class periods and also the capability to answer her parents without delay if they reach out.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, she reported having noticed that student phones can produce notification sounds that interrupt classes and cause embarrassment for the students. Furthermore, she has witnessed peers using their phones during class despite rules against it, becoming distracted or distressed by messages they receive.</p>
                <p>“It is also typical for students to be distracted by their phones during their study hall periods,” Samantha noted.</p>
                <p>The discussion concerning smartphone use in schools is now garnering statewide focus. Governor Kathy Hochul has commenced a listening tour to consult directly with educators, parents, and students while championing policies that bolster youth mental health. In a recent official statement, she pointed to a June 2024 Pew Research survey showing that 72 percent of high school teachers perceive cellphone distractions as a substantial issue within classrooms.</p>
                <p>“It is possible for us to aid our young people in achieving success in the classroom by guaranteeing they are engaged in learning and personal growth—not just clicking and scrolling,” stated Governor Hochul. “This is the reason I am collaborating with all interested parties across the state to create effective smartphone policies that will help shield our children's mental health and produce the best outcomes for our schools.”</p>
