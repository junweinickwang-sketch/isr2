While phone use is often permitted during after-school programs, it is generally not allowed during lunch or other instructional breaks. Phones must either be stored in a designated area like lockers or backpacks, or secured in <a class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/22/yondr-phone-pouch-schools-students" data-show-preview="true">locking pouches</a> that are kept by the student or in a central location.</div></li><li><div><strong>Partial Prohibitions:</strong> Students are permitted to use their phones during non-instructional periods, such as in between classes or at lunchtime.

Cyberbullying has become an instantaneous and pervasive issue, capable of spreading in seconds through social media to the entire student body and beyond. <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-10">[10]</a><a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-19">[19]</a></p>

Shari Obrenski, who is the president of the Cleveland Teachers Union, noted that high school students employ their cell phones to arrange, film, and share fights on social media, stating, "They were using the phones to create chaos and perpetuate violence in our schools." <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-10">[10]</a><a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-19">[19]</a></p>
                                                                            <p class="topic-paragraph">After examining over 400 videos of school fights, <em>The New York Times</em> "identified a trend of middle and high school students using phones and social media to orchestrate, incite, record, and circulate footage of violent altercations among their peers." In some cases, students involved later succumbed to their injuries. <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-20">[20]</a></p>
                                                                            <p class="topic-paragraph">Journalist Natasha Singer reported, "School officials indicated that the rapidly evolving technology habits of young people have complicated efforts to prevent and manage student aggression. Many students now favor more private communication methods—such as Snapchat, iMessage, and Apple’s AirDrop file-sharing service—to organize and distribute fight videos, rather than using platforms like Instagram or TikTok." <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-20">[20]</a></p>
                                                                            <p class="topic-paragraph">This indicates that policies banning social media or blocking student devices from accessing the school’s Wi-Fi network are not sufficient. In contrast, a ban on cell phones entirely eliminates this avenue for escalating conflicts.</p>
                                                                            <p class="topic-paragraph">Furthermore, banning cell phones offers individual students a shield from physical and emotional distress. One study revealed that "when iPhone users were prevented from answering their ringing device while completing a word search puzzle, their heart rate and blood pressure rose, and their self-reported feelings of anxiety and unpleasantness intensified." The sound of an unanswered phone is particularly effective at triggering FOMO (fear of missing out) in young people. There is no reason for children and teenagers to face such stress and anxiety. Removing phones completely provides students with both literal and figurative space to breathe, away from their devices. <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-21">[21]</a></p>
                                                                            <p class="topic-paragraph">Lastly, cell phone prohibitions serve to protect the privacy and data of students. An increased number of users on a Wi-Fi network renders it more susceptible to cyberattacks due to issues like network congestion, weak security measures (for example, <em>IheartDavid</em> is not a strong password), and a greater probability of someone clicking on a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/phishing" class="md-crosslink pro" data-show-preview="true">phishing</a> link. Such attacks can compromise not only the student data held by the school—including addresses, birth dates, and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/procon/Social-Security-debate" class="md-crosslink pro" data-show-preview="true">social security</a> numbers—but also the data on the students' own devices, thereby exposing a broad range of personal information from private conversations to financial and medical records. <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-22">[22]</a><a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-23">[23]</a><a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-24">[24]</a></p>

These containers have a confining appearance and feel, and some also seem rather foreboding (like something from a prison). <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-54">[54]</a></p> </blockquote>

                                                                            <blockquote> <p>We cannot ignore the powerful connection that exists between students and their phones. When I was an educator and later a principal—and being from a different generation—it required time for me to grasp this concept fully. Phones initially seemed to be a hindrance between myself and the students I was teaching. I had 10th-grade students who were reading at a 3rd-grade level, and I needed to figure out how to bridge the gap that I knew could have a profound impact on their future health and economic opportunities.</p> <p>A realization occurred for me when I saw that a device could function as a tool and an entry point for learning, not merely as an obstacle. The current reality in classrooms is that students are familiar with having their phones present—and they have been taught to interact with technology with ease. For many children, particularly in districts that do not have the funds to supply alternative devices to students, the phone acts as a calculator, a translator, a small computer, and a gateway to information.</p> <p>At the same time, educators have witnessed a surge in effective digital learning tools, many of which are based on apps. These tools enable students to remain engaged for longer durations, advance in their educational paths at their own speed, and allow teachers more valuable time for small-group instruction and social-emotional learning. <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-48">[48]</a></p> </blockquote>

Digital activities can vary from significant (such as reading or connecting with family members who are far away) to trivial (like playing Candy Crush) or even detrimental (such as cyberbullying). I use the phrase "screen value" to define the degree of advantage a child gains from digital pursuits. When we prohibit phones, we are telling children that none of the activities on their device hold any genuine worth. This is precisely the opposite of the message we ought to be imparting. While insignificant, and certainly harmful, digital activities have no place in a school setting, a phone ban eliminates the chance to teach that there are also valuable and enriching activities that can be performed on those very same devices. <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-46">[46]</a></p> </blockquote>

I had my phone with me because I was experiencing some health problems and had been given permission to have it. When the school was placed on lockdown, I sent a text to my stepdad, who is a police officer, and he informed me that several other schools had received the same report, and it was not authentic. Although the event was still very frightening, I received information from an outside source that helped to reassure me and those around me. Without my phone, I would not have been able to obtain this information. If more students had been allowed their phones that day, everyone would have felt a great deal more secure.</p> <p>The primary justification for not allowing students to have their phones in class is the concern that they would be on them constantly and would be unable to learn due to the distraction. While this is a valid concern, it is not entirely accurate. If students were aware that they would have designated time to use their phones later, the majority of them would not use them during the times they were not permitted to. Naturally, there would be some students who would exploit the privilege of having their phones, but if they were to receive a written warning or detention at that point, it would be a fair consequence. <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-55">[55]</a></p> </blockquote> </section><section data-level="1" id="ref417570"> <h2 class="h1">Policies on School Cell Phone Use in U.S. States and Territories</h2>
