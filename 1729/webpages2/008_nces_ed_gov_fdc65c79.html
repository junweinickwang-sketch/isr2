    <title>Official Announcement: Majority of Public School Administrators Report Cell Phones Harm Academic Achievement - February 19, 2025</title>

<body>
    <h1>Over Half of Public School Leaders State That Cell Phones Detrimentally Affect Academic Performance</h1>
    <p><em>A majority of schools maintain policies that limit cell phone usage during instructional time, with many identifying negative consequences for attention and academic results.</em></p>

    <section>
        <p>WASHINGTON (February 19, 2025) &mdash; New data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reveals the degree to which public schools have instituted policies to curtail cell phone use. The most recent findings from the <a href="/surveys/spp/">School Pulse Panel (SPP)</a> show that 77 percent of public schools forbid students from using cell phones during any class period. A greater proportion of elementary schools (86 percent) have enacted such a policy when compared to high or secondary schools (55 percent). Furthermore, 38 percent of schools that have cell phone policies also enforce restrictions on cell phone use outside of the classroom, for instance, during free periods, between classes, or at extracurricular events. It is notable that 30 percent of schools forbid cell phone use during all classes in addition to these non-instructional situations.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>&ldquo;The latest School Pulse Panel data underscores that school leaders perceive cell phones as more than a simple classroom distraction,&rdquo; stated NCES Commissioner Peggy Carr. &ldquo;With 53 percent of school leaders reporting adverse impacts of cell phone use on academic performance, and an even higher number noting negative effects on students&rsquo; mental health and attention spans, schools are confronting a significant issue. Educational institutions are responding with practical measures, such as banning or limiting phone use.&rdquo;</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The School Pulse Panel additionally offers insights concerning artificial intelligence (AI) within public schools. A favorable perspective on teachers utilizing AI for their professional responsibilities is held by 69 percent of leaders. Public school administrators moderately or strongly concur that the integration of AI tools into teaching and learning will simplify tasks for teachers (72 percent), allow teachers to be more aligned with current teaching and learning requirements (70 percent), and permit teachers to become more effective educators (67 percent). Training on the application of AI is provided by 67 percent of schools to all or some teachers, staff, and/or administrators, although variations exist depending on school characteristics. Approximately half (47 percent) of schools educate some or all of their students about AI, with this figure being higher for high/secondary schools (72 percent), schools with 1,000 or more students (69 percent), and middle/combined schools (59 percent). Written policies regarding student AI use in school exist at only 31 percent of all public schools, and about one-third of public schools (32 percent) have instructors who employ software to detect whether a student's assignment has been generated by AI.</p>
        
        <p>In the domain of school facilities and infrastructure, a majority of public schools (87 percent) state they possess sufficient space for their student body, with 24 percent depending on portable or modular structures. High-speed internet is accessible to students throughout all school grounds and buildings at more than three-quarters of public schools (77 percent). Some form of cooling system is present in nearly all schools (98 percent), central heating is available throughout the entire main instructional building in most schools (87 percent), and the overall indoor air quality is rated as &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; by 80 percent of schools.</p>
        
        <p>The findings made public today are derived from an experimental data product of the School Pulse Panel, which polls public K-12 schools across the United States about high-priority education topics on a monthly basis during the academic year. The SPP data, gathered from December 6&ndash;20, 2024, originated from 1,490 participating public K-12 schools located in every state and the District of Columbia.</p>
        
        <p>Additional data gathered from 99 public K-12 schools in the U.S. Outlying Areas&mdash;which include American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands&mdash;are also accessible. The results from this data collection reveal that 36 percent of public schools in the Outlying Areas prohibit students from using cell phones during any class.</p>
        
        <p>Experimental data products represent innovative statistical tools developed using new data sources or methodologies. While experimental data might not satisfy all of NCES&rsquo;s quality benchmarks, they provide sufficient value to data users, especially when other relevant products are unavailable, to warrant their release. NCES ensures that experimental data products are clearly labeled as such upon their release.</p>

        <h2>Key Findings:</h2>
        
        <h3>Technology Devices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Over three-quarters of public schools (77 percent) maintain a cell phone policy that forbids students from having their mobile phone during any classes. Concurrently, 12 percent have a cell phone policy that permits teachers to determine if students can possess their cell phones during class, and 5 percent have policies that let students have their cell phones throughout all classes. Among public schools, 6 percent indicated they do not have a policy regarding students having cell phones in the classroom.
                <ul>
                    <li>In comparison to the national figure (77 percent), a larger percentage of elementary schools (86 percent) have a cell phone policy prohibiting students from having their cell phones during any classes, whereas a smaller percentage of high/secondary schools (55 percent) and schools with 1,000 or more students (61 percent) have this kind of policy.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Thirty-eight percent of public schools with a cell phone policy forbid their students from using their mobile phones in scenarios outside of class time (i.e., during &ldquo;free periods,&rdquo; between class periods, at extracurricular activities, during mealtimes, outside of school buildings but still on school property, and in other situations).</li>
            <li>In total, 30 percent of all public schools have a cell phone policy that disallows students from having their cell phone in any class or from using their cell phone at school.</li>
            <li>More than half of public school administrators (53 percent) believe that their students' academic achievement has been negatively affected by cell phone usage. Over two-thirds perceive that cell phones have had a detrimental impact on their students' mental health (72 percent) and attention span (73 percent). Overall, 52 percent of public school leaders believe that their students have been negatively affected in these three domains, while 9 percent feel students have been positively affected in these three domains.</li>
            <li>Approximately 9 in 10 public schools (88 percent) operate a 1-to-1 computing program that furnishes every student with a school-provided device, like a laptop or tablet, for the 2024&ndash;25 school year. Among these institutions:
