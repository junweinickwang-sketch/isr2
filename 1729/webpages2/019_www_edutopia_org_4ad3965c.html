            <p>Sixteen-year-old sophomore Olivia recently entered Principal Matteo Doddo's office to share some astonishing information: "I was able to get more work done today than I have for the last two weeks," she reported, which was a surprise even to her. She added, "I was not preoccupied with my cell phone."</p>

            <p>Just the day before, as the school was preparing to launch its new phone policy, that same student had stood before him in a state resembling a panic attack. Olivia’s anxiety was triggered by the sight of an empty Yondr pouch resting on the large wooden table in his office. Representatives from Yondr, a company that promotes its lockable containers as a "patented system to create phone-free spaces," had cautioned Doddo that such reactions were to be expected. They explained that for certain students, securing their phones would be a traumatic experience, especially at first. Doddo remembers that on that Monday filled with anticipation, Olivia’s hand shook as she held her phone above the pouch to check its size, maintaining a cautious distance as if afraid "it was going to bite her."</p>

            <p>However, on the following day, Olivia, along with 900 fellow students from ninth to twelfth grade at Newburgh Free Academy’s North Campus in Newburgh, New York, put their phones into Yondr pouches for the entire school day, despite her anxiety. Within a month, an additional 2,200 students at the school's main campus were set to do the same.</p>

            <p>Principal Doddo was initially uncertain if his students would be willing, or even able, to spend a full school day without their phones. "I now have confirmation that it is possible for them," he states with a smile. "It is challenging, as phones are certainly addictive. However, during the seven hours they are on campus, they are successfully managing it."</p>

            <h3>Establishing Control Over the Situation</h3>
            <p>This change had been anticipated for quite some time. For nearly their entire existence, cell phones have served as a significant academic distraction and a catalyst for social drama at Doddo's school, with previous policies proving ineffective at controlling their use. Earlier regulations at the school mandated that phones be kept in lockers or bookbags throughout the day. Nevertheless, students frequently disregarded this rule, covertly bringing phones into classrooms and restrooms and distributing videos of staff and peers recorded without permission.</p>

            <p>The situation was complicated by inconsistent enforcement of the rules as students moved through the building between classes. Certain teachers maintained a strict policy, which resulted in many of Newburgh's disciplinary actions at the time being linked to the use of electronic devices during class time and defiance when students were asked to put their phones away. In contrast, other teachers became weary of reiterating the rules that were continuously being ignored.</p>

            <p>A great number of students find that the potential reward outweighs the risk. Research from a 2016 study on technology in college classrooms showed that students used over one-third of their class time for non-educational purposes such as social media, texting, handling emails, and even online shopping or watching films. Additional studies indicate a significant link between phone accessibility and an increase in student visits to mental health counselors and psychologists. Furthermore, research psychologist and educator Larry Rosen asserts that cell phones can severely limit a student's creative thinking. Rosen clarifies that the mere presence of a phone affects "fluid intelligence, which is your capacity to approach problems from new angles, think creatively, or allow your mind the freedom to discover that innovative space."</p>

            <p>The aspect of Yondr that captured Doddo's interest was its ability to eliminate numerous enforcement gaps. Each morning, as 900 students enter the school through two separate doorways, a small group of staff supervises them placing their phones into a Yondr pouch. The students then tap the pouch on a magnetic hub to lock it before storing it in their backpacks. Access to their phones is restricted until the school day concludes, with no exceptions for lunchtime. If a student forgets, loses, or damages their pouch, they must complete a form with their name, ID number, and an explanation. This form is then secured to their phone with a rubber band and collected in a basket for retrieval from the main office after school.</p>

            <p>The entire procedure is remarkably efficient, considering the scale of the undertaking. It is completed in approximately 35 minutes, starting from when the first bus arrives at 6:35 a.m. until the first period begins at 7:10 a.m.</p>

            <p>Doddo acknowledges that the initial implementation was challenging, but resistance has been slight, and distractions in the classroom have dropped significantly. He notes, "From the very first day, teachers and staff emphasized to us, 'This has created such a positive change in my classroom. Students are attentive. They are raising their hands. They are more involved.'" Inside Carrie Maiale's ninth-grade English class, the silence during reading time was profound, with students concentrating on a more traditional, slower-paced medium, even with the unannounced arrival of the principal and a reporter. Crucially, the Yondr pouches have eased a persistent source of friction between students and educators. "Ultimately, there is no ambiguity with this system—the phone is either secured in the pouch and powered off, or it is not," Doddo stated.</p>

            <h3>A Single Policy Is Not a Universal Solution</h3>
            <p>Principal Kristy Zaleta faced significant challenges at her middle school in Danbury, Connecticut. She had always understood and accepted that supervising hundreds of 12- and 13-year-olds involves a degree of conflict and tears. However, the behavior she observed in her students after the pandemic was unprecedented in her two decades as an educator, marked by frequent fights and daily property damage. "It simply turned into a mob mentality," she recounts. "If there was a hint of a fight, suddenly everyone would be running toward it; I even saw a girl on crutches hurrying to get a look."</p>

            <p>The existing phone policy, which granted teachers considerable discretion in establishing rules for their own classrooms, was a central cause of many issues. "Repeatedly, our inquiries traced back to videos posted by students that were filmed during school hours, provocative text messages sent during lessons and from the restrooms, and social media content that promoted violence and vandalism as though it were entertainment," Zaleta explains in an article for <em>Principal Leadership</em>.</p>

            <p>The school considered using Yondr pouches, but she was dissuaded by the expense, which ranged from $25 to $30 per student, as well as by stories of students breaking the magnetic locks and ruining the pouches. Consequently, Zaleta, along with her two assistant principals, consulted with parents, teachers, and students to assess the community's opinion. A vast majority, students included, concurred that a change was needed. As a result, Rogers Park Middle School was set to implement a new policy that would completely ban cell phone use during instructional time.</p>

            <p>In contrast to Doddo's school, teachers here have the final say on how the policy is enforced within their classrooms, provided the fundamental restrictions are upheld. Some teachers, such as seventh-grade math instructor Grace McKinley and eighth-grade American History teacher Joe Barata, utilize hanging cell phone holders provided by the school. Other teachers simply mandate that students keep their phones stored securely and out of view. Avery Rourke, a sixth-grade ELA teacher, initially used the caddies—where students place phones into pockets on a wall-mounted organizer—but discovered they created a different kind of distraction. She explains, "There were students who felt somewhat self-conscious because they didn't own the latest iPhone."</p>

            <p>During lunch, and for short periods between classes to check schedules, students are permitted to use their phones. While this presents an opportunity for daytime cyberbullying to occur, it has not yet become an issue at Rogers Park. Zaleta is optimistic that the time students might otherwise spend sending unkind messages in the lunchroom will be redirected to a more positive activity: recess. Although students have always had the option to go outdoors after their meal, she anticipates that limiting phone access throughout the day will encourage greater social interaction and more physical play.</p>

            <p>The overall atmosphere within the school has seen a significant transformation. "When combined with a reduction in computer use in class, we are observing an increase in peer-to-peer discussions," Zaleta reports, noting the school's shift towards more human-focused instructional methods. "We are noticing that children are more engaged in their classes. While they may not always be enthusiastic about learning math, they are no longer being sidetracked by a device vibrating in their pocket."</p>

            <h3>Achieving Buy-In Requires Careful Planning</h3>
            <p>While contemplating a new cell phone policy for his middle school in Luxemburg, Wisconsin, Principal Todd Chandler determined that it was crucial for the entire community, particularly the students, to collectively recognize and address the issue. "The most important factor for me is ensuring that everyone comprehends the reasoning behind this initiative," he stated.</p>

            <p>During the current school year, a pilot program was introduced requiring students to store their phones in their lockers for the entire school day, a concept known as "away for the day." Recognizing that gaining acceptance would be a gradual process, Chandler scheduled the transition to start during the summer. He engaged in conversations with staff and parents to measure their support, offered informational meetings for questions, and arranged optional viewings and discussions of the documentary <em>Screenagers: Growing Up in the Digital Age</em>, which examines how adults can assist children in achieving a healthy balance with technology.</p>

            <p>The policy was first presented to new seventh-grade students and incoming eighth graders at the new student orientation for Luxemburg-Casco Middle School. At the start of the school year, teachers then conducted a thorough review of the updated expectations, processes, and procedures with all students.</p>

            <p>Certain classes provide students with a chance to examine their own relationships with cell phones. For instance, a warm-up exercise in Pam Fierst's eighth-grade ELA class asks students to consider the potential negative aspects of digital technology. The students identify many of the same concerns that adults have, such as dependency, addiction, loss of self-control, exposure to hackers and stalkers, scams, constant distraction, and the spread of misinformation. They propose solutions like setting limits on screen time, reducing social media usage, creating more secure passwords, and pursuing hobbies that are not dependent on technology.</p>

            <p>Principal Doddo, located on the East Coast, also adopted a comparable long-range strategy. An initial letter was mailed out over the summer to gently introduce the concept of the new policy, promising that further information would follow. Well in advance of these letters, school psychologist and intervention specialist Robin Mojica had been visiting classrooms to speak with students about how phones affect brain function, social growth, and the body's stress reactions. According to Mojica, the students found these discussions educational, which paved the way for school-wide restorative circles focused on their feelings about phones. Before the policy's launch in November, the entire North campus paused during third period on two separate occasions, once in September and once in October, to hold these conversations, with circles being formed in all areas, including the cafeteria and the gymnasium.</p>

            <p>In the initial days of the Yondr system's implementation, a number of students visited Doddo's office, showing clear anxiety about being unable to contact their families. In response, Doddo and his team worked to establish sensible alternatives while still upholding the policy's main goal. Students are permitted to use the phone in the main office to contact their parents. Additionally, for specific situations evaluated on an individual basis, a magnet is available in his office to unlock the pouch, allowing a student to text or call using their own cell phone.</p>

            <h3>Distractions May Change, But They Don't Disappear</h3>
            <p>According to Doddo, the hallways of Newburgh Free Academy are once again alive with the sound of student conversations, and students now walk quickly between classes, free from the characteristic stooped posture of the cell phone era. Educators report that the new environment has been especially beneficial for students who were struggling, providing them with the opportunity to improve their performance and begin passing their courses again. Although the policy at Newburgh is still new and its direct effect on state test scores cannot yet be determined, Doddo hopes to eventually establish a clearer connection between the policy and academic results.</p>

            <p>However, the issue of student disengagement in school existed long before cell phones, and while educators can effectively combat distraction, they cannot eliminate it completely. Students under Doddo's and Zaleta's supervision, much like students in any school, may revert to traditional distractions such as passing notes, drawing, or merely gazing out the window.</p>

            <p>In a New York City school that lately began using Yondr pouches, a straightforward instruction for students to organize into discussion groups is met with unresponsive looks. The students remain seated, like quiet travelers on a bus, indifferent to its path or destination. They are merely present for the journey. Zaleta and her team, however, recognize the larger problem and are prepared to address it. "We have dedicated significant effort not only to the regulations concerning cell phones but also to our methods of engaging with students and the teaching strategies that foster more student-to-student interaction," she states. "The question is, how do we capture their interest with something genuinely captivating?"</p>

            <p>Doddo concurs that the role of a principal has changed dramatically compared to six years ago. He consistently reminds himself and his faculty that while cell phones have been removed, the effort to capture students' attention is far from over. "We are pleased to report that this initiative has been successful, yet we understand the importance of being realistic about the aspects that were not effective," he clarifies. "We are a community of over a thousand individuals sharing a single building; incidents will occur, and we must be ready for them. Nevertheless, I am very proud that we are undertaking this challenge as a unified team."</p>
