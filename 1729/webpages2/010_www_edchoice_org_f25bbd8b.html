            <h1>A Midyear Review of 2024 Polling Data: Examining Parental Pessimism and School Cell Phone Policies</h1>

        <main>
            <p>With 2024 at its midpoint, a comprehensive review of six months of K-12 education polling reveals a clear consensus: both parents and the general American public perceive this school year as having a challenging beginning. Negative sentiment regarding the trajectory of education has now reached its most significant peak in the last four years. Incidents of bullying and the implementation of cell phone bans in schools are reportedly increasing. Simultaneously, parents who are dissatisfied with current schooling options are actively exploring alternatives, such as school choice initiatives and microschooling models. Our extensive polling data spans hundreds of pages; consequently, this summary focuses on the most prominent highlights observed during the first half of the year.</p>
            <p>Each month, EdChoice conducts surveys of American adults and parents with school-aged children, addressing a range of subjects from the purpose of education to school safety. In collaboration with Morning Consult, our monthly polling gathers insights from nationally representative samples, which include about 2,200 American adults and 1,200 parents of school children. Additionally, we conduct national surveys of both teachers and teenagers on a semi-annual basis. The latest survey targeting adults and parents was actively collecting data from June 5 to June 7, 2024. The complete report can be accessed through this link.</p>
            <p>The following are six principal findings from the initial six months of 2024:</p>
            
            <h2>Finding 1: Pessimism Regarding K-12 Education Reaches a Four-Year High Among Americans and Parents.</h2>
            <p>Since January 2020, our monthly survey has posed a consistent question to respondents: whether they believe the American education system is progressing correctly or has deviated onto an improper course. Public sentiment reached its lowest level in February, as optimism concerning K-12 education descended to a four-year nadir. Just one-third of Americans (33%) believed their local school district was on the right path, while a mere 22% expressed a positive outlook on education nationwide. Parents of school-aged children, who consistently show more optimism about schools than the general population, also experienced this downturn in sentiment during February. Fewer than half of the parents surveyed (49%) indicated that their local schools were proceeding in the right direction, with 32% feeling optimistic about the state of education across the country. The previous instance of such low figures occurred when educational institutions were grappling with the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

            <p>Following that period, public opinion regarding the trajectory of education has shown minimal recovery. Slightly more than one-third of Americans (35%) currently express satisfaction with the direction of their local schools, whereas positive sentiment for education on a national scale persists at a low 22%. The perspectives of school parents have remained largely consistent. Slightly more than half of all parents (55%) believe local-level education is performing well, and 33% maintain a positive view of education nationally.</p>

            <h2>Finding 2: A Divide Exists Between Parents and Teachers on School Cell Phone Policies.</h2>
            <p>During the initial six months of 2024, there has been a significant surge in advocacy for prohibiting cell phones within schools. As an illustration, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's new bestselling book, "The Anxious Generation," has generated considerable discussion by contending that smartphones are contributing to a mental health crisis among youth and advocating for their removal from school environments. Certain states, including Ohio, Florida, and Indiana, have initiated measures to enforce stricter regulations on cell phone use in schools.</p>
            <p>However, data from March 2024 shows that 71% of parents with school-aged children believe students should be permitted to possess cell phones at school, while 38% endorse the presence of cell phones within the classroom itself. Teenagers express even stronger support for having cell phones at school (91%) and allowing them in the classroom (65%). Conversely, approximately half of all teachers (56%) believe students should be allowed to have cell phones in school, yet only 17% of educators approve of cell phones being present in the classroom. This trend suggests that emerging school policies banning cell phones could become a significant point of contention between parents and teachers.</p>

            <p>Parents of students also tend to underestimate their children's social media usage when compared to teacher observations. As of April 2024, while 38% of parents estimated their children use social media very often, two-thirds of teachers (67%) reported that their students engage with social media with high frequency. These figures are notably higher for high school parents (53%) and high school teachers (87%).</p>
            <img src="https://www.edchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Q2blog_Chart6-1024x575.jpg" alt="A graph showing that teachers report significantly higher rates of student social media use than parents do.">
            <p>In a similar vein, a majority of school parents believe that access to social media has exerted a positive influence on their child. Their most positive assessment was regarding social media's effect on their child's relationships with peers and classmates (64%), while they were least positive about its impact on their child's academic performance and physical health (51%). Teenagers' views generally align with their parents on these points. Once more, teachers hold a sharply different opinion. They indicate that social media has a detrimental effect on students across every aspect of their lives. Teachers are most worried about social media's impact on students' mental health (12%), physical health (14%), and self-confidence (14%).</p>

            <h2>Finding 3: Bullying Has Become the Primary Reason for Parents to Change Their Child's School.</h2>
            <p>An additional question we consistently monitor is the rationale behind parents' decisions to switch their child's educational institution. Over the past year, parents have consistently identified the same top three challenges at their child's previous school: excessive anxiety or stress, bullying, and unmet academic needs. Each of these three issues was regularly mentioned by 20-30% of school parents; for instance, in August 2023, the figures were 28% for excessive stress, 26% for bullying, and 26% for unmet academic requirements.</p>
            <p>In our most recent survey, bullying has distinctly separated from the other issues to become the foremost reason for changing schools. In June, 36% of parents who switched schools identified bullying as a significant problem for their child at the former school. In contrast, the percentages for excessive stress/anxiety and unfulfilled academic needs both held constant at their prior rate of 28%. Regardless of whether this increase reflects a rise in bullying incidents or heightened parental awareness, it is evident that ensuring a safe school environment is a paramount concern for parents in 2024.</p>

            <p>For a comparative perspective, we inquired with teenagers about how effectively their school addresses safety concerns in our March teens survey. Only one-third of teenagers (33%) reported that their school manages bullying effectively. Their perception of school responses to bullying was the most negative when compared to other safety matters like violent behavior (35%), mental health support (37%), and gun safety (48%).</p>

            <h2>Finding 4: Support for School Choice Policies Continues to Be Strong.</h2>
            <p>Throughout 2024, both school parents and the general population have maintained solid support for school choice policies. Approximately three-quarters of parents and two-thirds of all Americans favor education savings accounts (ESAs), school vouchers, charter schools, and open enrollment options.</p>
            <p>Since the start of the year, approval for each of these school choice models has seen a slight increase among both Americans and school parents. To illustrate, support for ESAs grew from 67% to 71% among the American public, and it rose from 74% to 78% among parents with school-aged children. ESAs are consistently ranked as the most favored school choice policy, enjoying high levels of support across various demographics, including different political affiliations, age brackets, and income levels.</p>

            <h2>Finding 5: Parents in 2024 Show Interest in Non-Traditional Educational Models.</h2>
            <p>One of our most consistent and surprising discoveries is that a significant number of school parents express interest in their child learning from home for at least one day each week. As of June, nearly half of all parents (46%) stated a preference for some amount of at-home schooling. It is also noteworthy that more than half (54%) indicated they would prefer their child to attend school entirely outside the home, which is the highest figure recorded since we began asking this question in 2021.</p>

            <p>A considerable number of school parents are also keen on exploring small learning settings with fewer than 25 students. This educational method, often referred to as microschooling, has been featured prominently in headlines this year. In May, 13% of parents with school-aged children reported having a child enrolled in a microschool, while an additional 24% expressed an interest in obtaining more information about them. Parental interest in microschooling saw a slight decrease (to 20%) when we provided a more specific definition of microschools as non-traditional learning centers for homeschool, private, and charter school students.</p>

            <h2>Finding 6: Student Absenteeism Is Still High, and Parents Might Not Grasp the Full Extent of the Issue.</h2>
            <p>During this spring, a quarter of all teenagers (25%) self-reported that they had missed more than 10 days of school this year. In contrast, just last month, only 13% of school parents stated that their child had been absent for over 10 school days. This discrepancy suggests that children are likely missing more school than their parents realize.</p>

            <p>Compounding this concerning situation, 40% of teachers reported that their students were absent from class more often this spring compared to the fall semester. Approximately half of the teachers (45%) indicated that absenteeism rates remained about the same this semester, and a mere 14% of teachers observed an improvement in student attendance.</p>
