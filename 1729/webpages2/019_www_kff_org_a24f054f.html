<h1>An Examination of State Initiatives to Prohibit Cellphones in Schools and the Consequences for Youth Mental Health</h1>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nirmita Panchal and Sasha Zitter</p>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> Sep 5, 2024</p>

<p class="note"><em>Important Update: Figure 1 has been revised as of April 30, 2025, to include the newly passed cellphone prohibition laws in Arizona and New York.</em></p>

<p>As the 2024-2025 academic year approaches, an increasing number of states are either putting into effect or contemplating statewide prohibitions on cellphone use within schools. A significant number of educational leaders and policymakers propose that banning cellphones could help alleviate concerns about youth mental health and reduce distractions from classroom learning. This renewed focus on cellphone prohibitions comes after two official warnings from the U.S. Surgeon General regarding the crisis in youth mental health and the detrimental effects of social media, along with UNESCO's recommendations to curtail cellphone usage in educational institutions globally. School cellphone ban policies have notably garnered support from both political parties, distinguishing them from many other contemporary political topics, while the Biden-Harris administration persists in advocating for the online safety of young people. Simultaneously, the body of research demonstrating the efficacy of cellphone bans is scarce, and despite their adoption by several states, persistent challenges exist related to enforcement, making accommodations for exceptions, and ensuring equity.</p>

<h2 id="how-widespread-are-school-cellphone-bans">What is the prevalence of cellphone bans in schools?</h2>

<p>The practice of banning cellphones originated several decades ago due to worries about students using cellphones or pagers for drug-related activities, and the prevalence of these bans has varied over time. The percentage of public schools that forbade cellphone use was 91% in 2009, decreased to 66% by 2015, and subsequently increased back to 76% in 2021. State-level consideration of cellphone bans is now occurring due to mounting concerns about student academic performance and mental well-being, which are linked to the overuse of smartphones.</p>

<p><strong>As of April 30, 2025, a total of eleven states have enacted statewide policies that either prohibit or limit the use of cellphones in educational settings (Figure 1)</strong>. The specifics of these policies differ significantly from one state to another.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Arizona:</em></strong> In April 2025, Arizona's Governor enacted a bill requiring schools to curtail student cellphone usage throughout the school day, which covers non-classroom periods, allowing exceptions for educational or medical needs. Furthermore, the legislation mandates that schools limit student access to the internet and social media platforms.</li>
<li><strong><em>Arkansas:</em></strong> In February 2025, the Governor of Arkansas signed a law mandating that every school district establish a cellphone policy by the start of the 2025-2026 school year to restrict student phone use during school hours, a move that follows a 2024 pilot program. These policies require submission to and approval from the Arkansas Division of Elementary and Secondary Education.</li>
<li><b><i>California:</i></b> California's Governor has recently enacted the Phone-Free School Act, a law that obligates school districts and charter schools to formulate and implement a phone policy by July 2026 that either restricts or completely bans smartphone usage during school hours. Accommodations are permitted for medical needs, emergencies, academic activities, or when a faculty member grants permission.</li>
<li><strong><em>Florida:</em></strong> Florida enacted a phone prohibition for K-12 classrooms, which forbids cellphone usage during instructional periods and prevents access to social media on any device connected to the district's Wi-Fi. A digital literacy curriculum is also included, starting in the sixth grade, which mandates instruction on topics like the dissemination of misinformation via social media and the concept of a digital footprint. This ban became effective in July 2024.</li>
<li><strong><em>Indiana:</em></strong> Indiana's prohibition forbids students from utilizing any portable wireless device, such as cellphones, gaming consoles, laptops, and tablets, throughout instructional periods, although exceptions can be made by teachers, administrators, or in emergency situations. Consequently, every school board in Indiana is tasked with creating and publishing detailed policies for their respective schools, outlining specifics like device access during lunch and the penalties for violating the rules. This prohibition was implemented in July 2024.</li>
<li><strong><em>Louisiana:</em></strong> A ban was passed in Louisiana, set to take effect in the 2024-2025 academic year, which will forbid both the use and possession of cellphones for the entire school day. If students bring cellphones onto school grounds, the devices must be powered off and kept out of sight. Exceptions may be granted for students who need learning accommodations.</li>
<li><strong><em>Minnesota:</em></strong> A bill in Minnesota directs school districts and charter schools to adopt policies regarding student cellphone use and possession by March 2025; however, it does not detail the specific nature or scope of these policies.</li>
<li><strong><em>New York:</em></strong> In April of 2025, the governor signed a bill that directs school districts to devise and enforce plans to limit all student cellphone activity during school hours, including non-instructional periods, by the 2025-2026 academic year.</li>
<li><strong><em>Ohio:</em></strong> The ban in Ohio, much like Indiana's, mandates that each school district formulate and put into action official policies concerning cellphone use in school. The legislation provides for exceptions for students with health conditions needing monitoring or for those requiring learning accommodations. This bill is scheduled to become effective in July 2025.</li>
<li><strong><em>South Carolina:</em></strong> The state's ban was established through the Governor’s Budget Proviso 1.103, which compels public schools applying for State Aid to Classrooms to adopt the model policy from the State Board of Education starting in January 2025. The Board's model policy, approved in September 2024, disallows students from using unapproved electronic devices unless permitted for educational or health-related reasons. A specific exception is provided for students who are volunteers with emergency response organizations, requiring them to obtain written authorization.</li>
<li><strong><em>Virginia:</em></strong> The Governor of Virginia issued Executive Order 33, which directed state officials to gather public input on cellphones in schools. This feedback will be used to define "cellphone-free education" and to release model implementation strategies and draft policy guidance for public school systems. The governor also allocated $500,000 to assist with the implementation of these school cellphone policies.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>State-wide legislation to ban or restrict cellphone use in schools has been introduced in seventeen states, and education departments in seven states have issued recommended policies or pilot programs with similar goals of limiting cellphone use in schools (Figure 1)</strong>. Different states are employing a range of strategies to reduce cellphone usage during class time. In Connecticut and West Virginia, the state education departments have provided guidance on limiting cellphone access in schools (Figure 1). Pilot initiatives managed by the education department in Delaware are providing funds for students to use lockable magnetic phone pouches during the school day. Similarly, as legislation is being debated in Pennsylvania, the Governor has modified the current School Safety and Mental Health grant program to permit the acquisition of lockable phone pouches. Georgia has limited access to social media platforms on school premises, and New Jersey has formed a commission to investigate the impacts of social media usage at school. Utah saw the introduction of a bill that ultimately did not pass, but draft legislation suggests that efforts toward creating phone-free educational environments are ongoing in these states.</p>

<p><strong>Navigating the implementation and enforcement of cellphone prohibitions can present significant difficulties</strong>. The responsibility for enforcing these cellphone bans frequently falls on teachers as an additional duty. Managing exceptions to these prohibitions also poses a challenge, as numerous students may require their devices for medical monitoring or because parents have varied expectations about staying in contact. Furthermore, cellphone bans have highlighted issues of equity; for instance, a previous statewide ban in New York was rescinded in 2015 partly due to more stringent enforcement in schools attended by students from low-income families compared to those serving students from affluent backgrounds. Conversely, prohibiting cellphones has been associated with beneficial results, including improved test scores, particularly for students who generally do not achieve as high academically.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-connection-between-cellphone-use-and-mental-health">How does cellphone usage relate to mental health?</h2>

<p><strong>Young people frequently use their cellphones to engage with social media, an activity that has been connected to adverse mental health outcomes</strong>. A 2023 survey revealed that 51% of adolescents reported spending a minimum of four hours daily on social media platforms. For adolescents, social media usage is correlated with increased incidences of anxiety and depression, exposure to damaging content—to which young people are more vulnerable—as well as body dissatisfaction and eating disorders, particularly affecting girls. Overuse of and addiction to social media are linked to sleep disturbances, which can lead to negative neurological consequences. Nevertheless, social media engagement can also offer benefits to young people, such as providing avenues for self-expression, connecting with communities of similar interests, and gaining access to vital resources, including those for mental health.</p>

<p><strong>Reports from roughly nine out of every ten public schools indicate that cyberbullying—a type of bullying conducted via technological devices like cellphones—occurs among their students (Figure 2)</strong>. Cyberbullying is linked to significant social and emotional distress, depression, and suicidal thoughts among youth, with female and sexual minority students experiencing it more frequently than their peers. During 2023, 16% of all high school students reported being electronically bullied, a figure that was notably higher for LGBT+ adolescents (25%) and female students (21%). Technology can also be exploited to produce and distribute non-consensual, digitally altered pornographic material, a form of abuse that predominantly targets females and can severely harm their mental well-being. Additionally, research indicates a connection between cellphone ownership in youth and a higher likelihood of experiencing cyberbullying.</p>

<p><strong>Excessive cellphone use may interfere with in-person social interactions and is correlated with feelings of loneliness in adolescents</strong>. Developing and strengthening relationships with peers is advantageous for the well-being of young people and can serve as a protective factor for adolescents facing adversity. The distraction posed by cellphones can potentially hinder the development of these important peer relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Approximately 40% of public schools indicate that the unpermitted use of electronic devices by students has moderate to severe negative effects on both student learning and the morale of teachers and staff (Figure 3)</strong>. A large number of teachers state that student distraction from cellphones is a significant issue in their classrooms and that enforcing restrictions on cellphone use is a difficult task. The mere presence of smartphones can diminish cognitive capacity, particularly for individuals with a strong dependency on their devices, and notifications are known to disrupt concentration and attention. Moreover, there is a negative correlation between the amount of time spent on smartphones and academic achievement.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-known-on-the-effectiveness-of-cellphone-bans-and-other-actions-to-address-youth-mental-health">What evidence exists on the effectiveness of cellphone bans and related youth mental health initiatives?</h2>

<p><strong>Although evidence regarding the outcomes of school cellphone bans is not extensive, widespread concerns about the negative effects of smartphone use on the well-being of youth continue to prompt action from policymakers and educational leaders</strong>. The emerging research on student outcomes presents a mixed picture, with some studies indicating improvements in student mental health and academic performance, as well as a decrease in bullying, while other studies show minimal or no change. Despite inconsistent evidence on school bans, growing concerns about the harms of social media and internet use among youth have spurred the introduction of policy and safety measures at both state and federal levels. For example, policymakers have recently introduced bipartisan legislation—the Focus on Learning Act—which directs the U.S. Department of Education to study the effects of cellphone use on students' academic and mental health outcomes, among other requirements. Furthermore, as of December 2024, the U.S. Department of Education has urged all states and districts to implement policies for managing cellphone use in schools and has issued guidance that includes sample policies, considerations for accommodating diverse student needs, and guidelines for policy evaluation and adjustment. This guidance was released as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's initiatives to address youth mental health and online safety. Other comprehensive strategies are also being enacted, such as the continued efforts by the Biden-Harris administration to enhance online safety for children. These efforts include the establishment of the Kids Online Health and Safety Task Force, which recently published Best Practices for Families and Guidance for Industry, and a Call to Action aimed at combating image-based sexual abuse. In addition, the Surgeon General has proposed that social media platforms feature a warning label indicating that social media is associated with poor mental health outcomes in adolescents.</p>
