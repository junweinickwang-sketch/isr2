            <p><strong>In summary</strong></p>
            <p>Educational institutions that prohibited mobile phones several years ago provide valuable insights for other districts as the governor calls for stricter enforcement.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The positive outcomes of prohibiting student cellphones are readily apparent at Bullard High School in Fresno. Principal Armen Torigian reports that incidents of bullying have declined, while student socialization has improved.</p>

        <p>Successfully enforcing the restrictions on smartphones, however, has presented a greater challenge.</p>

        <p>Rather than securing their devices in the required magnetically locked pouches, some students substitute other items, such as an old phone, a calculator, a glue bottle, or an empty phone case. Some students damage the pouches by pulling at the seams, cutting the bottom, or altering them to appear locked when they are not. While the majority of students adhere to the policy, the non-compliant minority generates significant disruption.</p>

        <p>“The extent of the problem is significant,” Torigian stated. “While declaring a no-phone policy sounds effective, many fail to grasp the level of phone addiction and the lengths students will go to resist having their phones taken away.”</p>

        <p>Having initiated its phone restrictions two years prior, Bullard High School is ahead of many other California schools that have only recently started to forbid cellphones in classrooms. The experiences of Bullard and other early-adopting schools provide a glimpse into the potential outcomes as these bans become more widespread. Educators who have implemented such restrictions report that they enhance student engagement and decrease bullying, but they also introduce new difficulties, such as securely storing phones from determined students and recognizing and addressing genuine device addiction among children.</p>

        <p>Using Bullard as a case study, Governor Gavin Newsom recently encouraged school districts across the state to take immediate action by adopting comparable restrictions on smartphone usage. He reminded them that a 2019 law already grants them the legal power to implement such policies. Following this, Los Angeles Unified, which is the second-largest school district in the country, has approved measures to prohibit phones beginning in January. Currently, one bill under consideration by the state Legislature would establish similar limitations statewide, while another proposal aims to forbid the use of social media on school grounds. A third bill would stop social media platforms from delivering notifications during school hours, as one component of a wider set of rules designed to combat social media addiction.</p>

        <p>The calls to regulate student smartphone use are partly fueled by the apprehension of educators. A Pew Research Center survey published in June revealed that one-third of middle school teachers and almost three-quarters of high school teachers consider smartphones a significant issue. A 2023 study by Common Sense Media found that in a single school day, the typical student gets 60 notifications and uses their phone for 43 minutes, which is about the duration of one class period.</p>

        <p>There is an increasing push to shield young people from excessive screen time in general:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>In June, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy called on Congress to mandate that social media companies include warning labels on their content to safeguard young individuals.</li>
            <li>Attorneys general representing 45 U.S. states have initiated legal action against Meta, alleging a failure to protect children.</li>
            <li>The widely-read book <em>The Anxious Generation</em>, which was released in March, draws a connection between the rise of smartphone use and a decline in the mental health of young people, urging parents to insist that school districts ban smartphones until high school.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These actions to restrict smartphone use position California at the vanguard of a growing national movement. In New York, Governor Kathy Hochul has reportedly been contemplating a statewide school smartphone prohibition for a number of months. States such as Florida, Ohio, and Indiana have already enacted some form of statewide limitations on phones in schools, with several other states having introduced comparable legislation. In June, Education Week reported that 11 states either restrict student phone use or encourage their school districts to do so.</p>

        <h3>How a Smartphone Ban in San Bernardino Led to Higher Teacher Satisfaction</h3>

        <p>For many years, teachers have maintained their own classroom policies regarding phones; the new development at schools like Bullard is the implementation of comprehensive, campus-wide prohibitions. A significant number of the institutions that were early to embrace such bans are smaller charter schools, such as Soar Academy, a TK-8 charter school in San Bernardino serving 430 predominantly low-income students. Similar to Bullard, Soar Academy also discovered that enforcing its ban was difficult. Suspension was not a viable disciplinary measure, nor was physically confiscating phones from students. This situation resulted in an honor system, which depended on students' acceptance that smartphones and social media negatively impact their mental well-being and divert their attention from learning.</p>

        <p>“The crucial element was securing 100% commitment from our teachers. A single weak link was not an option,” explained Soar's principal, Trisha Lancaster. “It was a daunting prospect because we were uncertain if it would succeed. Nevertheless, we were committed to making the attempt.”</p>

        <p>Lancaster mentioned that it was also beneficial to not offer parents or students a say in the decision. The school simply announced the new policy, providing extensive research on the detrimental impacts of cellphones and social media on young individuals, and clearly outlined the consequences for non-compliance.</p>

        <p>For a first infraction, the staff would confiscate a student's phone for the remainder of the day and contact their parents. The disciplinary measures would then increase with subsequent offenses, culminating in a meeting with the school board for a sixth violation, where board members might recommend that the student transfer to another school.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“It was a daunting prospect because we were uncertain if it would succeed. Nevertheless, we were committed to making the attempt.”</p>
            <cite>Trisha Lancaster, principal, Soar Academy in San Bernardino</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>At Soar, the concept emerged toward the close of the 2022-23 academic year, as teachers expressed their frustration with inattentive students and a generally disheartening school environment. According to Lancaster, the students “had lost their social skills.”</p>

        <p>Consequently, the staff made the decision to prohibit phones during class, recess, lunch, and after-school hours—effectively, at all times except within a designated pickup area. Students are required to keep their phones powered off and stored in their backpacks when usage is not allowed.</p>

        <p>The initial year of the ban proceeded more smoothly than anticipated, Lancaster noted. Although some students and parents voiced objections, the majority recognized that the policy was designed for the students' own benefit. While academic test scores showed little change, a year-end survey of teachers revealed a significant increase in job satisfaction compared to previous years. Furthermore, Lancaster stated that the positive changes are clearly visible when walking through the campus.</p>

        <p>“The overall happiness on campus has improved dramatically. You can see children genuinely interacting, resolving conflicts, and enjoying themselves,” Lancaster remarked, becoming emotional as she depicted the school's atmosphere. “It is an additional rule to enforce, that's true. But education is vital, and students are now engaged in learning. This was the primary motivation for our decision.”</p>

        <h3>Phone Bans from San Mateo to San Diego</h3>

        <p>The outcomes at Soar have been replicated on a broader scale within the San Mateo-Foster City School District, which educates 10,000 students across 21 TK-8 schools located south of San Francisco. Following the full return to in-person learning in 2022, the district's teachers observed that many students were “engaging with their cellphones with an intensity not seen before the pandemic,” according to Superintendent Diego Ochoa. As a result, the school district instituted a smartphone ban at four of its middle schools in 2022.</p>

        <p>School administrators became persuaded to take this step after visiting a local high school that had already implemented a smartphone ban. During their visit, they observed students engaging in conversation and making eye contact with one another during breaks, rather than being engrossed in their phones.</p>

        <p>Ochoa states that the advantages of securing smartphones are demonstrated by enhanced test scores and an anonymous yearly student survey, which indicated a reduction in depression, bullying, and physical altercations during the 2023-24 school year compared to previous years. However, attributing these improvements solely to the smartphone ban is complex, as they could also be the result of other policy adjustments made concurrently, including the adoption of a “restorative” approach to discipline. This method focused less on detention and suspension and more on providing support from counselors. Nevertheless, when students were specifically asked about the policy and the most significant change in their education since its implementation, they reported that they are now more attentive in class.</p>

        <p>Ron Dyste also put a smartphone ban into effect and, much like Ochoa, endorses them. Dyste serves as the principal of Urban Discovery Academy, a TK-12 charter school in San Diego, which prohibited cellphones throughout the 2023-24 academic year due to a rise in bullying, harassment, and anxiety among students, as staff reported to CalMatters. He noted that nearly 90% of disciplinary issues, both at Urban Discovery Academy and at a previous school where he was employed, were linked to the improper use of phones or social media. These issues included students recording fights, circulating nude images of their peers, and inciting others to self-harm.</p>

        <p>“I might never be able to erase some of those images from my memory. The things kids can do to one another are truly awful,” Dyste commented. “The harm inflicted upon our children and our communities is undeniable.”</p>

        <p>Dyste conceived the idea to prohibit phones after he and his wife attended a Dave Chappelle performance where attendees had to place their phones in locked pouches.</p>

        <p>“My wife suggested, why don’t we implement this in schools?” he recounted. “We recognized that we needed to take action.”</p>

        <p>During the previous summer, the school informed families about the new policy and its justification through notices. According to Dyste, some students expressed disapproval, but parents were overwhelmingly supportive. The positive effects on the campus environment were noticeable almost right away.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“The harm inflicted upon our children and our communities is undeniable.”</p>
            <cite>Ron Dyste, principal, Urban Discovery Academy in San Diego</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Instead of students “secluding themselves with their screens,” Jenni Owen, the school's chief operations officer, observed that they used their breaks to converse, dance, play volleyball, and enjoy themselves. She noted that they cultivated empathy and a stronger sense of community.</p>

        <p>By the conclusion of the academic year, the school had recorded zero physical altercations. In contrast, the suspension rate for the prior year was 13.5%, which is nearly four times the state's average.</p>

        <p>“For schools debating whether to undertake this, I believe the answer is that we must,” Dyste asserted. “If we fail to teach children how and when to properly use this technology, we will witness a continued increase in suicide, sexual harassment, and anxiety.”</p>

        <p>State legislators have acknowledged the significance of promoting healthier technology habits among children. Under a media literacy law enacted in October, California students are now expected to receive instruction on “appropriate, responsible, and healthy behavior... in relation to current technology.”</p>

        <h3>To Pouch or Not to Pouch: The Enforcement Dilemma</h3>

        <p>To carry out smartphone prohibitions, some schools utilize either smartphone lockers or locked pouches, similar to those Dyste observed at the Dave Chappelle event.</p>

        <p>He initially attempted to use locked pouches from Yondr, a Los Angeles-based company, but faced several problems. Some students were breaking and forcing the pouches open, while others would listen to music throughout the day by connecting their earbuds to their secured phones via Bluetooth.</p>

        <p>“We were forced to send back the remains of the equipment,” he stated. Instead of partnering with Yondr, which quoted $6,000 for 110 students, Dyste sourced clear, plastic phone lockers from Amazon for $50 each and installed one in every classroom.</p>

        <p>Yondr provided a statement to CalMatters: “Our pouches are engineered for heavy-duty use, and we are constantly striving to enhance the durability of our product. Nevertheless, there will invariably be students who test the limits, particularly during the initial implementation of new policies. For this reason, it is essential for our team to collaborate directly with districts and administrators during the rollout of the Yondr Program. This ensures that the most effective policies and procedures are established for a successful school-wide integration. Without strict adherence to strong policies, schools may face challenges with student compliance.”</p>

        <p>Soar Academy also explored the option of buying Yondr phone pouches but was deterred by the $19,000 cost.</p>

        <p>The San Mateo-Foster City School District invested $50,000 to acquire Yondr pouches for its approximately 3,000 students. In this system, staff distribute the pouches at school entrances each morning, and at the end of the day, students swipe the pouch over a demagnetizer to unlock it. Students requiring an exception, such as for a family emergency, must go to the school's main office to request permission.</p>

        <p>Although Yondr pouches have a significant cost, Ochoa believes the investment is justified by the resulting improvement in student concentration.</p>

        <p>“Contact any five superintendents at random, regardless of their location, and ask them what they would be willing to spend for increased student attention. The value is in the millions,” he declared.</p>

        <h3>Student Perspectives on Phone Bans Show Mixed Feelings</h3>

        <p>Regardless of whether phones are secured in a transparent box or a silver pouch, Oakland High School senior Leah West views the requirement for students to lock away their phones as a punitive measure, especially when no rules have yet been broken. Although Oakland High School does not enforce a universal smartphone ban, her previous English teacher occasionally used Yondr pouches to secure student phones.</p>

        <p>“We ought to be given the opportunity to demonstrate our responsibility,” she remarked, noting that this type of policy can provoke a rebellious attitude in students like her who value their freedom and dislike being distrusted to act responsibly.</p>

        <p>Louisa Perry-Picciotto, who completed her high school education in Alameda this past June, pointed out that students with jobs depend on their phones for work-related communications, and all teenagers use their phones to stay in touch with friends.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, she expresses gratitude that her parents delayed getting her a smartphone until she was in the eighth grade.</p>

        <p>“I am easily sidetracked, and living without a phone allowed me to be much more engaged with the world around me,” she reflected.</p>

        <p>Edamevoh Ajayi, a junior at Oakland Technical High School, acknowledges that it is undeniable some students are inattentive in class due to texting or playing games. She believes these students would certainly gain from the cellphone usage rules being introduced at her school this year.</p>

        <p>However, she personally feels she possesses a high degree of self-discipline and a genuine interest in learning, and thus does not require a phone ban for herself.</p>

        <p>“When my personal items are taken from me, it makes me feel as though I am being treated like a young child,” she expressed. At her school, the policies differ from one classroom to another. Generally, students have the freedom to use their phones during the time between classes and throughout their lunch break.</p>

        <p>When students use their phones during class, it can create a frustrating situation for everyone else, according to Fremont High School science teacher Chris Jackson. This places teachers in a difficult dilemma: they must either overlook the student's behavior to continue the lesson for the attentive students, or they must interrupt the learning process for the entire class to address the issue.</p>

        <p>In the broader context, Jackson expressed his concern that Black and brown students, who have historically been subjected to higher rates of punishment compared to their peers, will once again be disproportionately affected by disciplinary measures stemming from smartphone bans. Instead of punitive actions, Jackson advocates for solutions that tackle the underlying problems, such as addiction, which cause students to violate the rules with their devices. Therefore, regardless of the policy that school districts implement, he insists that the primary objective should be to educate students on digital literacy and the health risks associated with social media.</p>

        <h3>Making Adjustments: Schools Revise Phone Policies</h3>

        <p>Several schools that were among the first to implement smartphone bans have since re-evaluated their original strategies.</p>

        <p>This school year, Bullard is modifying its policy to permit students to use their smartphones during lunchtime. Principal Torigian explained that the school administration aimed to accommodate essential communications, such as allowing students who are responsible for picking up younger siblings to coordinate with their parents. They also anticipated that the more lenient regulations would lead to greater student compliance with the overall ban.</p>

        <p>If students fail to comply, teachers will contact their parents; if the non-compliance continues, the students are directed to what the school terms its "re-engagement center." Since last month, a new California law has prohibited suspensions for acts of “willful defiance.” Torigian contends that schools require an exemption from this law to effectively enforce smartphone restrictions. He advocates for its reinstatement, stating that he needs a mechanism to ensure students are held accountable.</p>

        <p>“This is why the governor needs to provide us with some flexibility regarding willful defiance; you cannot implement one policy [smartphone restrictions] without the other,” he stated.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“Our teenage students informed us, ‘You neglected to clarify the reasons for implementing this.’”</p>
            <cite>Diego Ochoa, superintendent, San Mateo-Foster City School District</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Ochoa mentioned that if he were to implement the policy again in San Mateo-Foster City, he would allocate more time to explaining the rationale behind it to the students before it took effect. He noted that acquiring a smartphone is a significant event for middle school students, a rite of passage for teenagers that symbolizes increased freedom and independence. He believes it is detrimental to the school's atmosphere if students feel they are being punished or if something they cherish is taken away without a clear explanation.</p>

        <p>“Our teenage students informed us, ‘You neglected to clarify the reasons for implementing this,’” he shared, emphasizing that even a small number of students violating the policy can have a substantial negative impact on academics and the school's culture. “Despite your firm belief in implementing a policy like this, it is crucial to invest time in crafting the language surrounding it and communicating it effectively to your students.”</p>

        <p>Jim Steyer, the CEO of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization that concentrates on how children interact with media and technology, concurred that the most effective approach is to explain to children the necessity of a rule that restricts smartphone access at school. He added that parents and teachers require the same clear explanation so they can assist in enforcing certain limitations to maintain the safety and well-being of the children.</p>

        <p>“Any parent who is even slightly involved will want their child to succeed academically, and they will want them to grasp why phones and social media platforms can obstruct learning, be highly distracting, and negatively impact their mental health,” he commented.</p>
