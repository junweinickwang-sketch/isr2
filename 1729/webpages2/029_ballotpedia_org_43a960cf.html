    <h1>State Policies on Cellphone Use in K-12 Public Schools</h1>
    
    <p>The debate over handheld electronic devices in schools began in the 1980s, as a growing number of students started bringing pagers onto campus, prompting school leaders and educators to consider their role in educational settings. Concerns arose among educators that these devices might cause classroom disruptions and negatively impact students' academic performance. These apprehensions persisted with the widespread adoption of cellphones and smartphones in subsequent decades, compelling school districts to establish policies that regulate the use of personal devices on campus, specifying locations and times.</p>
    
    <p>Across the majority of states, the responsibility for establishing policies regarding cellphones and other technologies in public schools typically falls to local school boards or superintendents. Data from the <i>National Center for Education Statistics</i> (NCES) indicates that for the 2021-22 school year, approximately 76% of schools prohibited the non-academic use of cellphones during school hours, a decrease from 91% in 2010. Many high school administrations have permitted students to use their cell phones during specific, designated periods of the school day, for instance, during their lunch break.</p>
    
    <p>Starting with Florida's initiative in 2023, a number of states have begun to enact specific laws or policies to regulate how students use cellphones within public schools. Supporters of such restrictions contend that cellphones serve as a major distraction for students, which can adversely affect the learning process, and they often cite academic research that links cellphone and social media use to increased anxiety and depression among children. Conversely, opponents argue that the enforcement of classroom cellphone bans presents significant challenges and note that many parents rely on cellphones to maintain contact with their children, particularly in emergency situations.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Prior to the current discussions about restricting cellphones in classrooms, a similar concern was raised by lawmakers, school district leaders, educators, and parents regarding the potential impact of an earlier technology in schools: pagers.</p>
    <p>During the 1980s, there was apprehension that pagers could be used for drug trafficking, leading school boards and city councils in some cities to ban students from bringing these devices onto campuses. In 1988, for example, the Chicago City Council enacted an ordinance that prohibited pagers in all of the city's private and public schools. States such as Maryland and Kentucky also passed laws making it illegal for students to bring cellphones and pagers to school.</p>
    <p>Pagers were eventually replaced by cellphones, which an increasing number of Americans began to own throughout the 1990s. According to Gallup, by the year 2000, half of all American adults reported owning a cellphone. That number climbed to 82% by 2010. During this time, it became more common for children to use cellphones, which led school leaders and educators to worry about potential distractions and the increased ease of cheating.</p>
    <p>Some school districts, including New York City's, maintained a ban on cellphones and other electronic devices in schools through the 1990s and into the 2000s. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the New York City Department of Education re-evaluated this ban, with a representative stating a desire for students to be able to contact their parents in an emergency. In 2015, the New York City Department of Education officially rescinded its ban on cellphones in schools, a policy that then-Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) had supported during his campaign.</p>

    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <p>While few people advocate for students to have unsupervised access to electronic devices in classrooms, those who oppose complete bans in schools argue that there are appropriate times and places for cellphone use. For instance, opponents of outright bans point out that parents often use cellphones to contact their children during the school day.</p>
    
    <h3>Arguments Supporting Banning or Limiting Cellphones in Schools and Classrooms</h3>
    <h4>Claim: Cellphones Disrupt the Learning Environment</h4>
    <p>New York University Professor Jonathan Haidt has stated that cellphones are a source of distraction for students and prevent them from engaging with their classmates.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>To effectively shift students' focus away from their phones during school hours, it is necessary to mandate that all students secure their phones and other text-capable devices in a locker or locked pouch upon arrival. Reports from schools that have implemented phone-free policies consistently indicate a positive shift in school culture, with students demonstrating greater attentiveness in class and increased social interaction with peers. This anecdotal evidence is supported by published academic studies.</p>
        <cite>—Jonathan Haidt</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Claim: Limiting Access to Cellphones During the School Day Can Reduce Bullying</h4>
    <p>Education writer Matthew Rhoads has argued that restricting access to phones can help decrease bullying, which he notes often originates on social media before spilling over into the school environment.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A significant portion of the bullying observed in our schools originates in the digital realm. I have discussed this with K-12 administrators across the country, who describe how major behavioral issues and bullying incidents often stem from phone use. They report that these conflicts start on phones and then manifest in person within our classrooms and hallways. While we cannot control how students use their phones outside of school, we can reduce their use during school hours, which significantly curtails the time available for covert bullying.</p>
        <cite>—Matthew Rhoads</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Arguments Opposed to Banning or Limiting Cellphones in Schools and Classrooms</h3>
    <h4>Claim: Schools Should Teach Students How to Have a Healthy Relationship with Technology Rather Than Ban Cellphones Altogether</h4>
    <p>Writer and teacher Erica Barry has suggested that schools have a responsibility to teach students digital literacy and how to use their devices responsibly, without fostering addiction.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Considering what is known about how phones and social media can incite violence, damage mental health, and shorten attention spans, the argument for removing these devices to create safe learning environments appears compelling. However, if the goal is to prepare students for the complexities of the wider world, administrators should focus less on implementing bans and more on helping teenagers learn to achieve balance and maintain focus amidst the constant allure of their devices.</p>
        <cite>—Erica Barry</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Claim: Students from Marginalized Backgrounds May Not Have Alternatives Outside of Cellphones for Developing Digital Literacy</h4>
    <p>University of Michigan education professor Liz Kolb highlights an argument that students from low-income and other marginalized backgrounds might not have access to computers at home. Kolb explains that these students often depend on cellphones as their primary tools for building digital literacy skills.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Historically, research has shown that students from marginalized groups, such as our Black and brown students or those from lower-income families, typically have less access to desktop or laptop computers at home compared to more affluent students. However, they do tend to have access to smartphones. For some families, these devices are their only means of digital access. Therefore, teaching students to use them in an academically productive manner is an essential life skill. Prohibiting cellphones in schools removes the chance to provide this crucial education to the students who are most likely to need it, presenting a clear equity argument for their inclusion.</p>
