        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>

        <p>The presence of smartphones in educational settings is causing escalating damage to the academic and social maturation of American children. These devices are diverting students' focus from their studies, hindering their ability to socialize in healthy ways, and creating disciplinary challenges within classrooms and across school grounds. Educators express frustration, students are experiencing negative effects, and parents perceive a difficult struggle against both technology and social pressures. Since 2012, academic scores in mathematics, reading, and science have shown a consistent decline throughout the United States. By 2022, the circumstances had become critical, as test scores for the students with the lowest academic performance fell to levels not observed since the 1970s. Furthermore, research has repeatedly demonstrated that immoderate use of smartphones adversely affects both immediate academic grades and the development of skills over the long term.</p>

        <p>A school serves not just as a place for academic instruction, but also as a child's primary social setting. Traditionally, the responsibility has fallen to teachers and administrators to help oversee this social setting, ensuring students cultivate healthy behaviors and to intervene in cases of bullying and mistreatment. As the social interactions of schoolchildren have increasingly shifted to the virtual domain, even while they are physically present together, it has grown nearly impossible for teachers and administrators to provide this vital adult guidance and correction. When one peer insults another with a name, a teacher can readily intervene and handle the situation; however, adults are significantly less likely to detect instances where a student is being harassed via social media during class time. A real-world example from New York City illustrated how cyberbullying incidents surge when phones are permitted in school. In the 2013–14 academic year, New York City enforced a cellphone prohibition and recorded only 178 cyberbullying incidents. Subsequently, the district lifted the ban, and the number of such incidents surged to 804 by the 2015–16 school year.</p>

        <p>A large number of schools and local authorities have acknowledged that phones detract from learning and discipline, and have consequently forbidden their use during class periods. This represents a positive move, yet classroom-specific policies are not enough on their own. The success of these policies fluctuates depending on the rigor and persistence of individual teachers, who frequently express their frustration with having to act as "phone police" while attempting to educate their students. This has led to a situation where, despite classroom bans, numerous students continue to use and be distracted by their own or others' phones during instructional periods.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, numerous mobile applications, particularly social media platforms, are engineered to capture our focus even when we are not actively engaged with them. Even if students restrict checking their feeds and posting images to breaks between classes, it is probable that they will still dedicate mental resources and attention, at least for the initial minutes of each class, to being preoccupied by what they have just viewed or by contemplating the responses to their posts. Policies limited to the classroom also fail to address the harmful group-level social dynamics that arise from phone access in hallways, cafeterias, and restrooms; these dynamics impact even children not active on social media and obstruct the development of healthy in-person social abilities. These policies also do not resolve the disciplinary problems that stem from cyberbullying or from students recording photos or videos of each other without permission.</p>

        <p>Considering these factors, the most effective policy is unquestionably a ban on phones throughout the entire school day. Studies suggest that eliminating phones for the whole school day leads to far more significant gains in academic achievement compared to just prohibiting them within the classroom. For a school's phone policy to achieve maximum effectiveness, it needs to be a total ban that is consistently enforced with clear consequences.</p>

        <p>This memorandum will provide an overview of how a bell-to-bell, no-phone policy can be successfully implemented and will detail the essential elements for its effective execution, using various state and local policies as illustrations. Smartphones have held America's youth captive for a sufficient period. Educational institutions can play a pivotal role in the effort to liberate children from the addictive nature of these devices and the detrimental social atmosphere they foster.</p>

        <h2>The Effectiveness of School Smartphone Bans</h2>

        <p>A 2024 Norwegian study that contrasted middle schools with smartphone prohibitions against those without them discovered that banning smartphones decreased instances of bullying for both male and female students, and enhanced girls' grade point averages, test results, and their chances of enrolling in an academic high school program. The most significant finding, however, was the effect on mental well-being. Female students experienced a 60% reduction in visits to specialist care for psychological symptoms and diseases, along with a 29% drop in consultations with their general practitioner for issues related to psychological symptoms and diseases.</p>

        <p>Following the implementation of a bell-to-bell phone ban by Orange County Public Schools in Florida last year, the district observed marked enhancements in student participation, social engagement, and a reduction in disciplinary problems. At Timber Lake, one of the high schools in Orange County, Principal Marc Wasko reported that bullying has not only diminished, but students are also more sociable and involved than they were prior to the ban. School districts such as South Portland, ME, Charlottesville City, VA, and Forest Hills Public Schools near Grand Rapids, MI, were also among the pioneers that prohibited student cellphone use not just in class but for the duration of the school day. Every one of these districts has noted comparable reductions in behavioral problems and bullying, as well as positive outcomes for their students. A student from Michigan remarked that eighth grade is an improvement over seventh because:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>During seventh grade, my morning routine involved spending more than an hour getting ready. It was essential for me to look absolutely perfect. Since all my friends had phones, I was constantly aware that any of them could pull one out in class, the hallway, or the restroom to snap a picture. This created a persistent, daily feeling of pressure to maintain a specific appearance so I would feel attractive in photos. No imperfections. I aimed for perfection. Now, with phones not being used by everyone, that pressure has lifted. I have nothing to be concerned about. I can act more like myself. I am finally able to be me.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The most profound effect of smartphone bans in schools, however, might be on closing the academic achievement gap. Among the first studies to evaluate the influence of removing smartphones on academic results was one conducted in 2016 by researchers from the London School of Economics. This extensive study, which included 130,000 students across 91 schools in four English cities, revealed that:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>student performance in high-stakes examinations shows a significant increase after a ban is implemented... these performance improvements are primarily seen in the lowest-achieving students. This indicates that the unregulated presence of phones has negative consequences for particular students, and restricting their use can be an inexpensive policy for diminishing educational disparities.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The researchers discovered that after a ban on phone use was instituted, the schools' overall test scores rose by 6.4 percent; however, for students who were underachieving (those in the lowest 25 percent based on previous achievement), the impact was twice as large, with their average test scores increasing by 14 percent. The previously cited Norwegian study also determined that the most significant positive outcomes of the bans were observed in girls from less affluent socio-economic backgrounds.</p>

        <h2>Key Elements of an Effective Phone Ban</h2>

        <p>When putting a smartphone ban into effect for the entire school day, three critical factors contribute to making the policy highly effective: 1) maintaining physical separation between the phone and the student, 2) implementing strong enforcement for any infractions, and 3) gaining the understanding and cooperation of parents.</p>

        <h3>1. Physical Separation</h3>

        <p>There are multiple approaches to phone-free policies. Some educational institutions might prohibit phones entirely from the school property, necessitating that students leave their devices at home. Other schools might mandate that students turn in their phones upon entering the building, retrieving them only at the conclusion of the school day. In a similar vein, schools can require students to store their phones in a designated secure area, such as a central phone locker, or employ Yondr pouches throughout the day to block student access to their phones. For schools where these methods are not feasible from a logistical standpoint, the next most effective strategy is a "never used, seen, or heard" policy, which permits students to store phones in their backpacks under the stringent rule that they are forbidden from taking them out or using them at any point during the school day, including during class transitions or lunch periods.</p>

        <p>For optimal results, phones should be not just out of view but also out of the students' direct possession. A 2017 study from the University of Chicago concluded that "the simple presence of one's own smartphone can create a 'brain drain' because limited attentional capacities are used to suppress the automatic impulse to focus on one's phone, making them unavailable for the current task." This conclusion is supported by data on phone bans. Research indicates that the more rigorous the ban, the better the outcomes. The study from Norway revealed that the beneficial effects on girls' grades, GPA, and test scores were most pronounced in middle schools that either forbade students from bringing phones to school or required them to surrender their phones before classes commenced, and were least significant in schools with more relaxed policies that merely required phones to be on silent during lessons and allowed their use during breaks.</p>

        <p>A comparable study carried out in the United Kingdom showed that in secondary schools with "effective bans" (defined as either not allowing phones on the premises or having students turn them in for the entire school day), the results on the national standardized test (GCSE) were one to two grades superior to those in schools with more lenient policies. What is most promising is that the study revealed this effect occurred even though the schools with strict ban policies had a greater percentage of students eligible for Free School Meals (indicating lower socio-economic status) than schools with more permissive policies, which further suggests that phone bans can contribute to resolving inequalities in academic achievement.</p>

        <h3>2. Enforcement</h3>

        <p>For any prohibition on phones to be successful, it must also be consistently enforced, preferably by the school's entire administrative team rather than just by individual educators. The use of pouches or lockers where students are required to place their phones during the school day simplifies the enforcement of bans, as teachers are not required to constantly monitor students as closely, and it becomes immediately apparent if a student has failed to store their phone in a pouch or locker.</p>

        <p>Policies must also include substantial and immediate repercussions for violations, which should be uniform and prominent enough to serve as a deterrent. In Orange County, Florida, the penalty for a first violation is confiscation, but this can be escalated to detention or even suspension for subsequent infractions. Principal Wasko noted that there were numerous phone confiscations in the initial days and weeks of the policy at Timber Lake; however, once students saw that the policy was being strictly enforced, the number of confiscations decreased because students ceased to take out their phones. At a middle school in Connecticut, producing one's phone results in an automatic detention. This strict enforcement has rendered the policy effective, and the school is observing positive outcomes. Examples of policies with consequences are provided below.</p>

        <h3>3. Parental Cooperation and Wider Implications</h3>

        <p>Schools should also endeavor to obtain parental comprehension and cooperation as they introduce any modifications to their phone policy. Parents frequently voice concerns that if phones are forbidden at school, they will lose the ability to communicate with their child as needed, such as for arranging transportation or during emergencies. Schools can provide reassurance to parents by explaining that classrooms are equipped with phones, allowing the office to contact a child if a parent needs to reach them, and that children can go to the school office if they need to contact a parent. This was the standard procedure less than a generation ago, and while contemporary parents might feel more secure with instant access to their children, it is vital for them to understand that this convenience can have severe negative impacts on their children's education and overall welfare. Schools have a significant part to play in educating parents about these impacts and helping them become more at ease with the compromises involved in their child being without a phone during the school day. Regarding emergencies, phones could potentially reduce safety by emitting light or sound that reveals a location, or by distracting from the need to run, hide, or follow instructions from emergency personnel. Furthermore, in an emergency where a phone could be useful, the teacher will still have their own device to make any required calls.</p>

        <p>On a broader note, while schools are unable to regulate activities outside of school hours, they should aim to foster a culture that encourages and enables parents who wish to provide their children with a phone-free upbringing. Numerous parents feel constrained from doing so due to social pressures or the fear that it would lead to their child's exclusion from important activities, and schools have often exacerbated this issue rather than offering a solution. Many schools have opted for the easiest route by utilizing applications such as Hudl to coordinate school sports and other extracurriculars. Students who want to join such activities are required to use a smartphone to view schedules or to correspond with coaches and teammates. Some schools have gone as far as to mandate specific apps for checking into school events or for submitting classwork. If schools start to enforce phone bans during the school day, they must also transition away from mandating apps for assignments or extracurriculars. If they persist in *requiring* phones for extracurricular activities, they will convey conflicting messages to students and parents, and perpetuate the ongoing negative consequences of phones among the student population.</p>

        <h2>The Current Landscape of School Phone Policies</h2>

        <p>Various states are now beginning to implement more decisive measures on a wider scale to remove phones from schools. Four states have currently enacted prohibitions on phone usage during teaching periods: Florida led the way by passing such a law in 2023, with Indiana and Ohio following suit in 2024. More recently, the Governor of Virginia has released an Executive Order instructing executive branch officials to develop guidelines on cellphone-free education policies for the state's school districts to implement. A few states have advanced even further. Louisiana and South Carolina, in quick succession this summer, have both declared bell-to-bell phone bans, effectively removing phones from the entire school day. Governors Gavin Newsom of California and Kathy Hochul of New York have also indicated their intention to explore phone bans for the complete school day in the near future. Pennsylvania and Arkansas intend to offer grant programs to school districts for the purchase of pouches to secure phones during school hours. Meanwhile, Kansas is in the process of forming a task force to address this matter.</p>

        <p>A number of local authorities have also enacted or are contemplating bans. The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), which is the second-largest school district in the United States, has recently declared a bell-to-bell phone ban that covers lunch and break times, although it is not scheduled to be implemented until January 2025. Although the particular details regarding the types of lockers or pouches that will be utilized are still being determined, it is positive to see the district undertaking such a significant policy. New York City, which is the country's largest school district, appears poised to do the same. Marietta County, located near Atlanta, has recently put a ban in place, and DeKalb County is conducting a trial of a similar initiative. The Katy Independent School District, which encompasses parts of Houston and some adjacent cities, has also enacted a ban, as has Granite County in Utah, another major school district. Policies that were once confined to specialized districts and small private schools just a few years ago have now gained the backing of a wide-ranging coalition of policymakers from all parts of the political spectrum.</p>

        <h2>Example Policies:</h2>

        <h3>Florida</h3>
        <p>Florida enacted the very first statewide prohibition on smartphone use during instructional periods, and it also forbids the use of TikTok on devices owned by the school and on school Wi-Fi networks. Regrettably, the Florida ban does permit phone use outside of class time; nevertheless, some of the most detrimental effects of social media are curtailed through the state's innovative strategy of banning TikTok.</p>
        <p>Relevant Portions of Florida Law, CS/HB 379:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>4. Prohibit and prevent students from accessing social media platforms through the use of Internet access provided by the school district, except when expressly directed by a teacher solely for educational purposes.</p>
            <p>5. Prohibit the use of the TikTok platform or any successor platform on district-owned devices, through Internet access provided by the school district, or as a platform to communicate or promote any district school, school-sponsored club, extracurricular organization, or athletic team.”</p>
            <p>“A student may possess a wireless communications device while the student is on school property or in attendance at a school function; however, a student may not use a wireless communications device during instructional time, except when expressly directed by a teacher solely for educational purposes. A teacher shall designate an area for wireless communications devices during instructional time. Each district school board shall adopt rules governing the use of a wireless communications device by a student while the student is on school property or in attendance at a school function.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Orange County, FL</h3>
        <p>When creating its regulations for the use of wireless devices within the district, Orange County opted to exceed the state's requirements by prohibiting phones for the entire school day, from the first bell to the last. This serves as a valuable illustration that local authorities should not feel constrained by state-level mandates and are free to implement more stringent policies that are better suited for their own districts.</p>
        <p>Orange County Policy:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Pursuant to the Technology in K–12 Public Schools law (CS/HB 379), which took effect on July 1, 2023, section 1006.07(2)(f), Florida Statutes, now provides that “a student may not use a wireless communications device during instructional time, except when expressly directed by a teacher solely for educational purposes. A teacher shall designate an area for wireless communications devices during instructional time.” The 2023–2024 Code of Student Conduct requires that wireless communications device(s)* be silenced and put away (in a backpack or purse) during the school day while on campus, including lunchtime and transitioning between classes.</p>
            <p><em>*Wireless communication devices include but are not limited to, cell phones and/or auxiliary/ancillary devices such as watches and ear buds.</em></p>
            <p>The following actions will be taken if a student violates OCPS’ cell phone policy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Confiscation (Item returned at the end of the day)</li>
                <li>Detention</li>
                <li>Positive Alternative to School Suspension (PASS)</li>
                <li>Out-of-School Suspension (OSS)</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Granite County, UT</h3>
        <p>Granite County, UT, another of the nation's largest public school districts, has now formulated a policy to ban phones. The proposed language is as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>In Elementary and Junior High Schools, subject to limited exceptions outlined below, use of personal electronic devices shall not be used, kept out of sight, and notifications turned off during school hours. In Senior High Schools, use of personal electronic devices shall not be used and must be kept out of sight and notifications turned off during instructional time. Personal electronic devices may be used during passing times and during lunch periods. However, in consultation with school community councils, senior high schools may develop further restrictions.</p>
            <p>Prohibited student uses of electronic devices during school hours shall incur administrative consequences:</p>
            <p>First violation: educator shall warn and redirect student.</p>
            <p>Second violation: educator shall confiscate the device and return it to the student at the end of the class period.</p>
            <p>Third violation: educator shall refer student to the office and the administration shall confiscate the device and return it to the student at the end of the school day.</p>
            <p>Fourth violation: educator shall refer student to the office and the administration shall confiscate the device and return it to the parent or guardian after alerting them to the violation.</p>
            <p>Additional violations: administration shall engage the parent or guardian to address the concern. Additional school consequences shall be evaluated and administered as appropriate.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>South Carolina</h3>
        <p>The state's FY 2024–25 budget included a condition stating that for school districts to be eligible for state funding, they must adopt the policy set forth by the State Board of Education. The South Carolina Department of Education (SCDE) is currently in the process of creating a policy that will prohibit the use of cell phones and other personal electronic communication devices throughout the school day. <em>The department aims for this policy to be fully in effect across the state by January 2025.</em> The budget proviso reads:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>To receive state funds allocated for State Aid to Classrooms, a school district shall implement a policy adopted by the State Board of Education that prohibits access to personal electronic communication devices by students during the school day. For purposes of this provision, a personal electronic communication device is considered to be a device not authorized for classroom use by a student, utilized to access the Internet, wi-fi, or cellular telephone signals.</p>
            <cite>Proviso 1.103 (SDE: Anti-Bullying/School Safety)</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>California</h3>
        <p>The text of AB 3216 (which has not yet become law) is as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The governing body of a school district, a county office of education, or a charter school <em>shall, no later than July 1, 2026, develop and adopt, and shall update every five years</em>, a policy to limit or prohibit the use by its pupils of smartphones while the pupils are at a school site or while the pupils are under the supervision and control of an employee or employees of that school district, county office of education, or charter school. <em>The goal of the policy shall be to promote evidence-based use of smartphone practices to support pupil learning and well-being. The development of the policy shall involve significant stakeholder participation in order to ensure that the policies are responsive to the unique needs and desires of pupils, parents, and educators in each community.</em></p>
            <p>(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a pupil shall not be prohibited from possessing or using a smartphone under any of the following circumstances:</p>
            <p>(1) In the case of an emergency, or in response to a perceived threat of danger.</p>
            <p>(2) When a teacher or administrator of the school district, county office of education, or charter school grants permission to a pupil to possess or use a smartphone, subject to any reasonable limitation imposed by that teacher or administrator.</p>
            <p>(3) When a licensed physician and surgeon determines that the possession or use of a smartphone is necessary for the health or well-being of the pupil.</p>
            <p>(4) When the possession or use of a smartphone is required in a pupil’s individualized <strong>education program</strong>.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

        <p>State and local school districts should implement school phone bans that remove phones not just from instructional periods but from the entire school day. The ideal policy would incorporate a method for physically separating students from their phones during school hours, such as using pouches or lockers, and would enforce substantial and uniform penalties for infractions, overseen by the entire school administration rather than solely by individual teachers. Lastly, schools should endeavor to communicate the policy change and its justification to parents to gain their cooperation and to show how parents' communication requirements with their children can be fulfilled without the children using their phones. Schools should aim to present their policies as a means of empowering parents who might feel overwhelmed by technology companies and peer influence, thereby making school days into sanctuaries for learning and healthy social interaction in a world where childhood is increasingly dominated by technology.</p>

        <p>Actions that would have been considered radically against the prevailing culture until recently are now receiving widespread support throughout the nation. A significant number of school districts and states have already drafted or enacted phone bans, providing examples for others to follow. The initial outcomes from these trials have demonstrated remarkably beneficial effects on both educational results and the mental health of students. Policymakers in other states and local school districts should feel assured in emulating these precedents and taking back their school days from the dominance of technology.</p>
