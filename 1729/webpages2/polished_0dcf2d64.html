<p><strong><em>This article, originally published Aug. 30, 2024, was last revised on July 14, 2025.</em></strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Cell phone bans and restrictions in K-12 schools continue to gain momentum this academic year. As of June 2025, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have signed or already enacted laws or policies regarding student cell phone usage in K-12 classrooms, according to a report from <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/State_policies_on_cellphone_use_in_K-12_public_schools" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ballotpedia</a>.</p>
<p>At a more local level, many school boards and districts have also voted to limit or ban cell phones in the classroom, some even before their state made it a requirement. For instance, in June 2024, the the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) School Board <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/lausd-school-board-votes-to-ban-cell-phones/159140/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">voted to ban cell phones and social media</a> during the school day.</p>
<p>As part of LAUSD’s policy, which <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/how-the-lausd-cell-phone-ban-will-work/163896/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">went into effect on Feb. 18</a>, phones must be turned off and stored away and cannot be put on silent or vibrate mode. Phones will not be allowed during lunch or breaks but can be used on campus before and after school hours.</p>
<p>According to a 2023 report from <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/constant-companion-a-week-in-the-life-of-a-young-persons-smartphone-use" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Common Sense Media</a>, half of kids ages 11 to 17 receive at least 237 notifications on their phones on a typical day — 25% of which are received during the school day. In the past year or so, dozens of <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/seattle-public-schools-sue-big-tech-allege-social-media-harms-students/119572/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">school districts have sued the parent companies of Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube,</a> alleging their apps cause classroom disciplinary problems and <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/tag/mentalhealth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mental health</a> issues and divert resources from education.</p>

<p>Aside from the more obvious concern of cell phones being a significant distraction from learning, in June, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/surgeon-general-warns-of-impact-of-social-media-on-youth-mental-health/123772/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issued an advisory</a> calling on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms regarding their effects on young people. The advisory said social media may cause body image issues, affect eating behaviors and sleep quality, and lead to social comparison and low self-esteem. According to 2022 data from the Pew Research Center, more than a third of teens ages 13 to 17 say they use social media “almost constantly” — including during the school day.</p>

<h3 id="which-state-was-the-first-to-ban-cell-phones">Which State Was the First to Ban Cell Phones?</h3>
<p>In May 2023, Governor Ron DeSantis signed <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/379" rel="noopener" target="_blank">House Bill 379</a>, making it the first state to use the legislative process to ban cell phones in classrooms. Both chambers of the legislature approved the bill unanimously.</p>
<p>“A student may possess a wireless communications device while the student is on school property or in attendance at a school function; however, a student may not use a wireless communications device during instructional time, except when expressly directed by a teacher solely for educational purposes,” the bill states. “A teacher shall designate an area for wireless communications devices during instructional time. Each district school board shall adopt rules governing the use of a wireless communications device by a student while the student is on school property or in attendance at a school function.”</p>
<p>In addition to banning cell phones in classrooms, HB 379 also requires schools to block access to social media platforms on school computers and Wi-Fi networks, except for educational purposes and to teach students in grades 6-12 about the dangers of social media.</p>
<h3 id="indianas-school-cell-phone-ban">Indiana’s School Cell Phone Ban</h3>
<p>In March 2024, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb signed <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2024/bills/senate/185/details" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Senate Bill 185</a> which bans cell phones and other portable devices, including laptops and tablets, during class. The Indiana House approved the bill 83-8 and the Senate approved it 49-0.</p>
<p>“Each school corporation and charter school shall adopt and implement a wireless communication device policy that: (1) except as provided in subdivisions (2) and (3) and subsection (d), prohibits a student from using a wireless communication device during instructional time; (2) authorizes a teacher to allow a student to use a wireless communication device for educational purposes during instructional time; and (3) permits a student to use a wireless communication device in the event of an emergency or to manage the student’s health care,” the bill reads.</p>
<h3 id="louisianas-school-cell-phone-ban-details">Louisiana’s School Cell Phone Ban Details</h3>
<p>In May 2024, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry signed <a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=246363" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Senate Bill 207</a> which bans cell phones throughout the instructional day. The bill went into effect this school year.</p>
<p>“…no student shall possess, on his person, an electronic telecommunication device throughout the instructional day,” the bill says. “If a student brings an electronic telecommunication device in any public elementary or secondary school building or on the grounds thereof during an instructional day, the electronic device shall either be turned off and properly stowed away for the duration of the instructional day or prohibited from being turned on and used during the instructional day.”</p>
<h3 id="south-carolinas-school-cell-phone-ban">South Carolina’s School Cell Phone Ban</h3>
<p>In July 2024, South Carolina lawmakers included a proviso in the 2024-2025 state budget that requires schools to ban students from using cell phones during the day to receive funding.</p>
<p>“To receive state funds allocated for State Aid to Classrooms, a school district shall implement a policy adopted by the State Board of Education that prohibits access to personal electronic communication devices by students during the school day,” the provision says. “For purposes of this provision, a personal electronic communication device is considered to be a device not authorized for classroom use by a student, utilized to access the Internet, Wi-Fi, or cellular telephone signals.”</p>
<h3 id="california-governor-signs-phone-free-schools-act">California Governor Signs Phone-Free Schools Act</h3>
<p>On Sept. 23, 2024, <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/california-governor-signs-bill-restricting-cell-phones-in-schools-texas-is-considering/162116/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Governor Gavin Newsom signed the Phone-Free Schools Act</a>, requiring every school district, charter school, and county office of education to develop a policy limiting the use of smartphones during school hours. The <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/23/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-to-limit-the-use-of-smartphones-during-school-hours/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">law</a> will go into effect July 1, 2026.</p>
<p>In 2019, Newsom first signed AB 272 into law, which specified that school districts have the authority to regulate the use of smartphones during school hours. Newsom later <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/lausd-school-board-votes-to-ban-cell-phones/159140/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced this past June efforts to restrict the use of smartphones during the school day</a>.</p>
<p>“As the Surgeon General affirmed, social media is harming the mental health of our youth,” he wrote in a statement. “I look forward to working with the Legislature to restrict the use of smartphones during the school day. When children and teens are in school, they should be focused on their studies — not their screens.”</p>
<p>Following Newsom’s June announcement, the California School Boards Association said it believes any regulations over student cell phone usage should be left up to individual school districts.</p>
<p>“We support legislation which empowers school leaders to make policy decisions at a local level that reflect their community’s concerns and what’s necessary to support their students,” said spokesperson Troy Flint.</p>
<p>The new law does have some flexibility. For example, schools can’t prevent a student from using a smartphone if a doctor says they need it for health-related reasons and some students in individualized education programs may be allowed to bypass the restrictions. During emergencies, students will also be allowed to access their cell phones, however, districts can determine what scenarios they deem to be an emergency and how the smartphones can be used.</p>
<h3 id="new-york-governor-signed-bell-to-bell-cell-phone-ban">New York Governor Signed ‘Bell to Bell’ Cell Phone Ban</h3>
<p>In Jan. 2025, New York Governor Kathy Hochul <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-plan-restrict-smartphone-use-schools-statewide-and-ensure-distraction" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unveiled a plan</a> to restrict smartphone use in schools statewide by the start of the 2025-2026 academic year. The legislative proposal includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>No unsanctioned use of smartphones and other internet-enabled personal devices on school grounds in K-12 schools for the entire school day, including classroom time and other settings like lunch and study hall periods.</li>
<li>Allows schools to develop their own plans for storing smartphones during the day — giving administrators and teachers the flexibility to do what works best for their buildings and students.</li>
<li>Proposes $13.5 million in funding to be made available for schools that need assistance in purchasing storage solutions to help them go distraction-free.</li>
<li>Requires schools to give parents a way to contact their kids during the day if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>On May 6, 2025, Hochul announced New York is becoming the largest state in the U.S. to require “bell-to-bell” restrictions on smartphones. The policy will take effect this fall for the 2025-2026 academic year.</p>

<h3 id="georgia-cell-phone-ban-doesnt-include-high-schoolers">Georgia Cell Phone Ban Doesn’t Include High Schoolers</h3>
<p>In March 2025, Georgia passed a bill that bans all personal electronic devices for students in grades K-8. The “<a href="https://trackbill.com/bill/georgia-house-bill-340-distraction-free-education-act-enact/2652386/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Distraction-Free Education Act</a>” mandates that students keep their devices out of sight, with exceptions for students with IEPs or medical needs. The ban will take effect in July 2026.</p>
<p>“This is a not just an academic bill,” Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after the bill was passed. “This is a mental health bill. It’s a public safety bill.”</p>
<h3 id="arizonas-school-cell-phone-ban">Arizona’s School Cell Phone Ban</h3>
<p>In April 2025, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs signed HB 2484, a bill requiring districts to limit cell phone use during the school day.</p>
<p>The law directs districts to write policies around cell phone usage and to share them with parents at the beginning of each school year.</p>
<h3 id="north-dakotas-school-cell-phone-ban">North Dakota’s School Cell Phone Ban</h3>
<p>Also in April 2025, North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong signed a bell-to-bell ban on student cellphone use. The law requires school districts to implement a policy that all personal electronic devices be silenced or turned off, securely locked away, and inaccessible to students.</p>
<p>“This is a game changer for our public schools, giving students the freedom to focus on learning and to interact with teachers and friends without the constant tug of their cell phones and addictive social media,” Armstrong said in a <a href="https://www.governor.nd.gov/news/armstrong-highlights-benefits-students-he-signs-bill-requiring-phone-free-k-12-public-schools" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news release</a>.</p>
<p>The law goes into effect for the 2025-26 school year.</p>
<h3 id="oklahomas-school-cell-phone-ban">Oklahoma’s School Cell Phone Ban</h3>
<p>In May 2025, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed into law a yearlong ban on student cellphone use in all public schools, according to the <a href="https://oklahomavoice.com/2025/05/06/oklahoma-governor-signs-mandatory-one-year-school-cellphone-ban-into-law/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oklahoma Voice</a>. Stitt signed Senate Bill 139 on May 6, implementing the “bell to bell” ban for the 2025-26 school year. The restriction becomes optional for districts the following year.</p>
<p>While the ban is in place, each district’s school board must adopt a policy restricting students from using cellphones, laptops, tablets, smart watches, smart headphones and smart glasses from the first bell until dismissal. School-issued or school-approved devices used for classroom instruction are still allowed under the law, and districts can permit cellphone use for emergencies or for students with medical needs.</p>
<h3 id="alabama-governor-signs-cell-phone-ban-bill-requires-social-media-training-for-8th-graders">Alabama Governor Signs Cell Phone Ban Bill, Requires Social Media Training for 8th Graders</h3>
<p>Also in May 2025, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey <a href="https://governor.alabama.gov/newsroom/2025/05/governor-ivey-signs-focus-act-preventing-use-of-cell-phones-in-alabama-public-schools/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">signed</a> the Freeing Our Classrooms of Unnecessary Screens for Safety (FOCUS) Act into law, prohibiting students from using smart phones and other wireless devices inside Alabama’s public schools.</p>
<p>The FOCUS Act also requires the Alabama State Department of Education to offer social media training for all students before entering the eighth grade.</p>
<p>“According to a recent survey, 72% of high school teachers in the country reported that cell phones are distracting students,” Ivey said. “We have also learned from parents that teens are spending an average of almost five hours every day on social media, and it is having a negative impact on their well-being.”</p>
<h3 id="nebraska-governor-bans-cell-phones-throughout-school-day">Nebraska Governor Bans Cell Phones Throughout School Day</h3>
<p>On May 20, 2025, Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen signed Legislative Bill 140, banning students from using cell phones on school property.</p>
<p>Another bill signed by Pillen, LB 383, requires social media companies to verify users’ age when they sign up, <a href="https://www.klkntv.com/nebraska-gov-jim-pillen-signs-school-cellphone-ban-social-media-age-limit-into-law/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ABC 8</a> reports. Anyone under 18 will need parental consent to create an account.</p>
<h3 id="washington-dc-issues-bell-to-bell-cell-phone-ban">Washington, D.C. Issues Bell-to-Bell Cell Phone Ban</h3>
<p>On June 6, 2025, District of Columbia Public Schools <a href="https://dcps.dc.gov/release/dc-public-schools-will-be-phone-free-beginning-school-year-2025-2026" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> the district will enforce a bell-to-bell personal cell phone ban policy starting next school year. Phones must be turned off and stored away during the school day.</p>
<p>The district says all of DCPS’ middle schools and several of its high schools have already implemented the ban and are seeing positive changes.</p>
<p>“Piloting a phone-free program in our middle schools demonstrated that storing students’ personal devices throughout the school day enriches academic, social, and emotional learning,” said DCPS Chancellor, Dr. Lewis D. Ferebee. “From increased classroom engagement to reduced anxiety and stronger student relationships—DCPS is ready to scale the program so we can keep driving outcomes that positively impact our students.”</p>
<p>Individual schools will be responsible for establishing an approach to the policy “that best fits the specific needs of their communities.”</p>
<h3 id="texas-governor-signs-bill-banning-cell-phones-in-school">Texas Governor Signs Bill Banning Cell Phones in School</h3>
<p>Most recently, on June 20, 2025, <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/texas-governor-signs-bill-banning-cell-phones-in-school/171701/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 1481</a>, requiring public school districts or open-enrollment charter schools to adopt and implement policies prohibiting students from using “personal communication devices” during school hours.</p>
<p>Under the bill, schools must either prohibit students from bringing devices on campus or find a way for students to store them while on school property. Schools are also required to have consequences in place for students who are found using the devices. However, exceptions will be made if a student has a doctor’s note or if a device is needed to comply with health or safety requirements.</p>
<p>Back in September, Texas Education Agency (TEA) Commissioner Mike Morath encouraged lawmakers to implement a ban in public schools across the state, noting cell phones are “extremely harmful” to student progress.</p>
<p>“If it were in my power, I would have already banned them in all schools in the state,” he said. “So I would encourage you to consider that as a matter of public policy going forward for our students and our teachers.”</p>
<p>The House approved the bill 128 to 17 with two no-votes. The Senate passed the bill by a 31 to 0 vote. School boards were given 90 days to adopt the policy.</p>
<h3 id="virginia-governor-issues-executive-order-on-cell-phones-in-schools">Virginia Governor Issues Executive Order on Cell Phones in Schools</h3>
<p>Although not a law, in July 2024, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin issued <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-33---Cell-Phones-7.9.24.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Executive Order 33</a> to “help bring cell phone-free education to Virginia schools.”</p>
<p>“Establish a detailed definition of ‘cell phone-free education’ which incorporates feedback from parents, students, teachers, and other stakeholders,” the order says. “The definition should address the age-appropriateness of all actions including the elimination or severe restriction of the use of cell phones and smart phones during instructional time, as well as input on age-appropriate restrictions on other personal electronic communication devices, such as smart watches, tablets, and computers connected to the internet during instructional time other than school authorized uses.”</p>
<p>Youngkin directed the Department of Education to create the guidelines, which were <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/virginia-department-of-education-to-release-final-guidance-on-cell-phones-in-schools/161911/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released on Sept. 17</a>. The document, “Guidance for Cell Phone-Free Education Pursuant to Executive Order 33,” bans students from using cell phones for the entire day, including during lunch and free time between classes. It is left up to school districts to decide whether students can carry their phones in their backpacks or whether they must be stored in a locker or locked pouch.</p>
<p>Virginia high school students may use their phones on school grounds before or after the school day. Elementary students who bring phones to school cannot use them on school grounds but middle school students can use their phones before or after school, depending on the policy the local school division sets.</p>
<h4>Alexandria City Public Schools Adds Smartwatches to Cell Phone Ban Policy</h4>
<p>According to a recent Study.com <a href="https://teachinglicense.study.com/featured-insights/smarthwatches-in-classrooms.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">survey</a>, 50% of teachers believe smartwatches have become a substitute for cell phones in classrooms. Another 40% report increased smartwatch usage since cell phone bans were implemented.</p>
<p>The same study found 60% of teachers cited texting as the top issue caused by smartwatches, and 60% of respondents also report students playing games or using apps on their smartwatches during class.</p>
<p>When Alexandria City Public Schools (ACPS) students returned to the classroom Jan. 2 after winter break, they were also unable to use their smartwatches in class. The ACPS School Board voted 8-1 last month to expand its ban on electronic devices to include smartwatches, <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/education/alexandria-schools-smart-watch-ban/65-0e01b2a1-9055-46aa-97d2-6d4757473d6a" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WUSA</a> reports. All electronic devices must be stored in backpacks, lockers, or a designated area in the classroom. Students can use devices on school buses traveling to and from school, and between campuses. Under the updated policy, students can face suspension or expulsion if caught using smartwatches in class.</p>
<p>During the Dec. 19 meeting, student representatives spoke about the challenges of the ban, noting they see teachers and other adults using their phones in school buildings.</p>
<p>“What we’re asking you to do is hard. It would be hard for any of us. I acknowledge that this is a tough ask. But I want something better for you, and I think this is an important step in improving your educational environment,” board member Dr. Ashley Simpson Baird said in response. “For me, this is coming from a place of improving the quality of your education when you’re with us.”</p>
<p>ACPS Superintendent Melanie Kay-Wyatt emphasized the school’s responsibility for student safety and communication with parents.</p>
<p>“I think the goal is about the safety. I want to say to parents, let us manage the inside of that facility to ensure that it’s safe,” she said. “If there’s a matter or something that they need to get to their child, a message or something, there’s always the office who could take care of that matter for them.”</p>
<h3 id="ohio-legislation-limits-cell-phone-usage">Ohio Legislation Limits Cell Phone Usage</h3>
<p>While not a statewide ban, Ohio enacted a law limiting cell phone usage in classrooms. In May 2024, Governor Mike DeWine signed <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/hb250" rel="noopener" target="_blank">House Bill 250</a> which requires districts to establish policies on cell phone use in schools.</p>
<p>“…each school district board of education shall adopt a policy governing the use of cellular telephones by students during school hours,” the bill says. “The policy shall do all of the following: (1) Emphasize that student cellular telephone use be as limited as possible during school hours; (2) Reduce cellular telephone-related distractions in classroom settings…”</p>
<p>Both the Ohio House and the Senate unanimously approved the bill.</p>
<p>School districts in Ohio have begun developing and implementing their cell phone ban policies. For example, Toledo Public Schools (TPS) will require students to store their cell phones in secure pouches or lockboxes during school hours beginning in August 2025. <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/toledo-public-schools-implement-cell-phone-ban/172335/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Click here</a> to read more about Toledo’s policies.</p>
<h3 id="4-states-encourage-districts-to-limit-student-cell-phone-use">4 States Encourage Districts to Limit Student Cell Phone Use</h3>
<p>Other states are strongly encouraging schools to implement policies, although it is at their discretion. Those states include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connecticut</li>
<li>Kansas</li>
<li>Oregon</li>
<li>Washington</li>
</ol>
<p>In Aug. 2024, the Connecticut State Board of Education also unanimously voted to adopt a policy encouraging districts to limit student access to cell phones during the school day.</p>
<p>“Given the risks and negative impact on learning and mental health, local and regional boards of education, in collaboration with school leaders, educators, families and students, should develop and enact a districtwide Personal Technology Use in Schools policy inclusive of cell phones and current and emerging technologies,” the board wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>Governor Ned Lamont and the board released a report that offers policy guidance for school districts to consider recommending complete removal of cell phones from elementary and middle schools.</p>
<p>In Aug. 2024, the Washington Department of Education adopted policies encouraging districts to limit cell phones in school. In Oct. 2024, the Oregon Department of Education urged school districts to look at their cell phone use policies to see if they should be tightened, <a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/digital-government/2024/11/how-one-schools-cell-phone-ban-going-after-two-years/401038/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Route Fifty</a> reports.</p>
<p>“It is important for schools to work purposefully to create conditions that promote deep thinking and sustained attention, free from the constant interruptions that cellphones and mobile devices can introduce,” ODE director Charlene Williams wrote in a news release.</p>
<p>Taft 7-12 Middle &amp; High School, located in Lincoln City, Ore., is now in its second year of banning cell phones. Students can’t bring them to school unless they are stored away in a magnetically-locked pouch, which cost the district $20,000. Teachers say students are more focused and engaged.</p>
<p>“I’m not dealing with as much drama and their social media things,” said Sarah Horobin, a teacher at Taft High School. “I see that they’re actually talking to each other more … and that’s something they’ve had to learn again.”</p>
<p>In Dec. 2024, the Kansas State Board of Education voted to approve the recommendations of an education task force that urged districts to prohibit students from using cell phones during the day.</p>
<h3 id="gov-tim-walz-requires-minnesota-schools-to-implement-cell-phone-use-policies">Gov. Tim Walz Requires Minnesota Schools to Implement Cell Phone Use Policies</h3>
<p>Other states have required or plan to require that schools put policies in place to minimize cell phone use in the classroom.</p>
<p>By March 15, 2025, Minnesota school districts and charter schools will be required to have policies in place regarding cell phone use after Governor Tim Walz signed <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=SF3567&amp;version=latest&amp;session_year=2024&amp;session_number=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Senate File 3567</a> in May 2024. The policies must “minimize the impact of cell phones on student behavior, mental health, and academic attainment.”</p>
<p>The legislation does not specify requirements.</p>

<p>Last summer, three states announced they were piloting programs to restrict cell phones in the classroom. Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Arkansas approved funding in 2024 to provide some districts with pouches for storing cell phones during classroom instruction.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2024, Delaware Governor John Carney signed a $168 million supplemental spending bill that allocated $250,000 for a state Department of Education pilot program for cell phone pouches. Under the pilot program, students would place their phones on locked pouches and would not have access to them until the end of the school day. Lawmakers suggested five to eight schools be chosen to participate in the pilot. The state DoE has been charged with implementing the pilot and collecting and evaluating data.</p>
<p>On July 2, 2024, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders also announced a pilot grant program that will provide pouches for students to store their cell phones. She told Fox News that 75% of the state’s districts plan to join the initiative. A statewide ban later went into effect in Feb. 2025.</p>

<p>“Teen math, reading, and science scores have dropped in the United States and other developed nations since 2012, while school alienation has risen across the board,” she said. “Arkansas’ phone-free schools’ program isn’t about taking anything away — it’s about giving kids the freedom to learn without distractions.</p>
<p>On July 11, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signed a bill allotting $100 million to schools for a grant program to limit cell phone usage during the day. Schools can use the grants to purchase pouches.</p>
<p>Some districts are also taking it upon themselves to implement pilot programs. In July, the DeKalb County School Board in Georgia <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/georgia-school-district-tries-to-reduce-cell-phone-use-on-campus/159858/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unanimously approved a pilot program</a> that takes two different approaches. One strategy involves students turning off their phones and placing them in a locked pouch that they carry with them during the school day. At the end of the day, they would touch the pouch to a magnet that would unlock it. The pouch strategy is being implemented at Salem, Henderson, Sequoyah, Lithonia, and Tucker middle schools and Lakeside, Cross Keys, Lithonia, Tucker, and Martin Luther King, Jr. high schools.</p>
<p>The second approach is cell phone lockers. That pilot will be implemented at Miller Grove, Druid Hills, and Chapel Hill middle schools.</p>
<h3 id="colorado-attorney-general-offers-50k-to-school-districts-that-restrict-cell-phones">Colorado Attorney General Offers $50K to School Districts That Restrict Cell Phones</h3>
<p>Colorado is taking a unique approach, <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/colorado-school-districts-offered-50000-to-restrict-cell-phones/163270/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">offering $50,000 to school districts that establish policies restricting cell phone usage in classrooms</a>. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser first announced his office’s plan to enact the new program <a data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="603fb249c323f39e54bbf9db" href="https://coag.gov/2024/attorney-general-phil-weiser-launches-initiative-to-fund-smartphone-strategies-in-schools-further-supporting-student-wellbeing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in September</a>, the same day he <a data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="603fb249c323f39e54bbf9db" href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/09/20/colorado-attorney-general-grant-program-school-districts-phone-policies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">attended a roundtable discussion</a> with leaders from Mesa County Valley School District 51. The Grand Junction-area district implemented a new phone policy this school year.</p>
<p>Under the new policy, students in K-8 are not allowed to have personal devices at school during the school day. Students in grades 9-12 are prohibited from using devices during instructional time but may use them between classes and during lunch, although it is discouraged.</p>
<p>“I did not get a lot of pushback from families,” said Superintendent Brian Hill. “I actually got more feedback from families saying, ‘Thank you for doing this.’ That doesn’t mean that there aren’t parents that were not happy with it.”</p>
<p>Hill said parents can get in touch with their students throughout the day by calling the school’s landline. He also argued cell phones can be counterproductive during an emergency.</p>
<p>“Safety and security folks do not actually want your kiddo on a phone during those moments,” Hill said. “They want the kid paying attention to the adult so they’re safe. And (phones are) a way that you spread misinformation a lot of times.”</p>
<h3 id="several-states-considering-cell-phone-bans-restrictions">Several States Considering Cell Phone Bans, Restrictions</h3>
<p>The list of states with cell phone bans, limitations, or proposed legislation continues to grow. In February, <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/illinois-governor-proposes-school-cell-phone-ban/167702/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Illinois Governor JB Pritzker proposed statewide legislation</a> that would ban cell phones during instruction time.</p>
<p>During his <a data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="603fb249c323f39e54bbf9db" href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/gov-jb-pritzker-announces-ban-on-cell-phone-use-in-illinois-classrooms/3678053/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">State of the State Address</a>, Pritzker noted that Illinois eighth graders had the second-highest reading scores in the nation in 2024 and fifth-highest math scores, emphasizing “more focus on learning will bring even greater success across our state.”</p>
<p>“Improving the classroom environment and limiting distractions is vital to student achievement, and in conversations with educators and parents around this state, there is one thing that they commonly cite as an impediment to in the classroom: cell phones,” he said. “Furthermore, <a data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="603fb249c323f39e54bbf9db" href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/tag/cyberbullying/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cyberbullying</a> has expanded at alarming rates and its time for Illinois to take measures to protect our kids. That’s why this session, I’ll move forward with legislation requiring all school districts in Illinois to adopt a cell phone policy that bans the use of phones during classroom instruction.”</p>
<p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/CgvWIwBTehk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sept. 18 hearing</a>, the Mississippi Senate Mental Health Task Force discussed restricting cell phones in schools.</p>
<p>“Through our work in the Mental Health Task Force over the past two months, we have analyzed and looked at data from many sources. Those sources include books like <em>The Anxious Generation</em> and feedback from leaders in education and mental health. We have also looked at actions being considered and taken in other states,” said State Senator David Parker (R), chairman of the task force. “This is creating a crisis that is reflected in countless areas. I expect our task force to recommend that cellphone use be restricted during [key instruction and interactive time]. We continue to look at best practices to achieve this goal and hope to have a legislative method to help achieve this goal.”</p>
<p>In September, Mississippi Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann (R) told <a href="https://vicksburgnews.com/states-are-restricting-cellphones-in-schools-mississippi-could-be-next/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Magnolia Tribune</a> that vast research shows the decline in mental health among children and adolescents is in past connected to the near-constant use of smartphones and social media.</p>
<p>“Students should be concentrating on learning, not texting during classroom instruction. School safety and ensuring parents can stay connected with their children are also important concerns,” Hosemann said. “We support legislation to allow local districts to determine how best to negotiate these concerns while still protecting classroom learning from distractions like smartphone use.”</p>
<p>In Jan. 2025, Wisconsin Republicans who control the Legislature proposed legislation banning cell phones and other electronic devices in K-12 classrooms with exceptions for educational purposes or during an emergency, according to <a href="https://www.tmj4.com/news/state-capitol/wisconsin-republicans-propose-banning-phones-in-school#:~:text=The%20measure%20brought%20forward%20in,and%20in%20cases%20of%20emergencies." rel="noopener" target="_blank">TMJ4</a>.</p>
<p>“We know it’s not going away, that this is not going to solve everything. Kids are still going to be getting on social media at night,” wrote Representative Joel Kitchens, the proposal’s author. “But we really need to teach them to use it responsibly. So hopefully they can learn when to put it aside and concentrate on what you’re doing.”</p>
<p>Many schools across the state have policies in place restricting the use of smartphones and other devices in class, but Kitchens says those policies have been largely ineffective.</p>
<p>“It’s very difficult to enforce and most of those schools do not enforce it very well,” Kitchens said. “So really, we mean this to be support for those schools.”</p>
<p>Since 2021, students a Saint Catherine’s, a private Catholic school in Wisconsin, have had to place their phones in magnetically locked pouches at the start of each day.</p>
<p>“I think once we sent everyone home for COVID, part of that was like, ‘You have to be on the device. I have to see your face. You have to be on your screen,'” said Zach Prideaux. a theology teacher at Saint Catherine’s. “So when all these kids come back, they’re locked in their phones all the time. Now they’re socializing, they’re engaging, they’re asking questions, they’re raising their hands. That’s what a school should look like.”</p>
<h3 id="cell-phone-bans-in-school-supporters-and-proponents-offer-strong-arguments">Cell Phone Bans in School: Supporters and Proponents Offer Strong Arguments</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, all of these decisions have been met with mixed opinions. For instance, two LAUSD board members voted against the June motion, citing how difficult it would be for teachers and staff to enforce the ban. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cell phones at school for non-academic use. However, as many educators can attest, students do not follow the bans or they are not enforced.</p>
<p>As part of LAUSD’s enforcement, students will receive multiple warnings if they are caught breaking the rules. The first is a verbal reminder, followed by a “referral to a counselor,” and then outreach to a parent or guardian.</p>
<p>Many parents have also criticized the decision, noting they want to be able to communicate with their children during school hours, particularly in today’s threat landscape. In a <a href="https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/blog/school-cell-phone-ban/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent survey from Prodigy</a>, 63% of parent respondents said their main concern with school cell phone bans is difficulty communicating with their children during emergencies. The <a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/4-dead-9-hospitalized-in-georgia-high-school-shooting/161464/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sept. 4 shooting at Apalachee High School</a>, which claimed the lives of two teachers and two students, stirred up more debates on the topic.</p>
<p>“The fact of the matter is parents and families cannot rely on schools to effectively communicate with us in times of emergency, and this has happened time and again,” said Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, an education advocacy group. “There’s a whole host of reasons why parents are deeply concerned about whether or not they’re going to get timely information about whether or not their kids are safe.”</p>
<p>Advocates of school phone restrictions warn that allowing access to phones during emergencies could put students in even more danger.</p>
<p>“What’s even more important to me is their safety,” Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone-Free Schools Movement, told <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/georgia-school-shooting-highlights-fears-classroom-cellphone-bans-113493372" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ABC News</a>. “If my child was on the phone with me and they missed guidance from the teacher because they were distracted by their phone and they weren’t safe, that’s a worse scenario in my mind.”</p>
<h3 id="some-schools-make-exceptions-to-cell-phone-bans">Some Schools Make Exceptions to Cell Phone Bans</h3>
<p>To address various concerns, some states and individual districts have come up with compromises or creative alternatives. In a last-minute amendment to California’s Phones-Free Schools Act, lawmakers added some exceptions, such as schools cannot prohibit students from using phones during emergencies. The proposed law does not include details on what constitutes an emergency, leaving it to schools to decide.</p>
<p>“We’re working under the assumption schools are going to be reasonable and responsive to legitimate parental concerns about being able to contact their kids in the aftermath of an emergency,” said Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), a co-author of the bill.</p>
<p>Grand Island Senior High School in Nebraska established a new policy in January, requiring students to keep phones out of sight or in their bags and silenced or off during school hours.</p>
<p>“One of the essential questions that parents asked us was, ‘What if Sally or Johnny doesn’t have their phone if, God forbid, an active shooting happens or there is some sort of crisis in the building?’” then-principal Jeff Gilbertson told ABC about the decision. “We coach our kids to keep phones silenced. You don’t want to be talking on the phone when we’re in lockdown, because that would reveal your location to an active shooter.”</p>
<p>Dr. Willough Jenkins, a pediatric psychiatrist at Rady Children’s Hospital and UC San Diego, told Fox News that lawmakers and schools should also take into consideration students who may need a device for medical reasons.</p>
<p>“There’s a certain population of children that are neurodivergent or with autism spectrum diagnoses, and they may be using devices to help with communication,” she said, adding other students with medical conditions, such as diabetes, may need to monitor their blood glucose. “I think we have to consider all of these situations when we’re making rules.”</p>
<h3 id="cell-phone-bans-further-disadvantage-the-disadvantaged">Cell Phone Bans Further Disadvantage the Disadvantaged</h3>
<p>In many school districts across the country, students have 1:1 access to laptops in the classroom. Many of the programs installed on the devices allow students to learn at their own pace based on their abilities and progress. It provides data that helps teachers better understand each individual students’ strengths and weaknesses. However, not all school districts are created equal.</p>
<p>“One-to-one technology implementation frequently falls short, with small budgets, outdated devices, and limited home access holding many low-income students back,” <a href="https://www.edweek.org/technology/opinion-why-school-cellphone-bans-are-a-bad-idea/2024/11" rel="noopener" target="_blank">writes</a> Brandon Cardet-Hernandez, a former public school principal and senior education adviser to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. “For many kids, especially in districts that lack resources to provide alternative devices to students, the phone serves as a calculator, translator, mini-computer, and a door to information.”</p>
<h3 id="do-parents-support-cell-phone-bans-in-school">Do Parents Support Cell Phone Bans in School?</h3>
<p>While some LAUSD parents voiced opposition to the ban, the previously mentioned Prodigy survey found that 64% of parents across the U.S. support banning cell phones during the school day. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/10/14/most-americans-back-cellphone-bans-during-class-but-fewer-support-all-day-restrictions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more recent survey</a>, conducted by Pew Research from Sept. 30- Oct. 6, 2024, found 68% of U.S. adults support a ban on middle and high school students using cell phones during class, including 45% who strongly support it. Another 24% oppose it while 8% said they aren’t sure.</p>
<p>The survey also found the public is much less supportive of a full-day ban on cell phone use than a classroom ban. About 36% support banning cell phones for the entire day, including during lunch and between classes. By comparison, 53% oppose this more restrictive approach.</p>
<h3 id="do-teachers-support-cell-phone-bans-in-school">Do Teachers Support Cell Phone Bans in School?</h3>
<p>The Prodigy survey also found nearly three in four teachers support a ban on cell phones, although 46% said implementing screen time restrictions during the school day is a better approach than banning them altogether.</p>
<p>On average, teachers surveyed said they discipline students for using their cell phones five times a week, and 46% said they have confiscated students’ phones. Teachers also largely agreed that a ban would improve students’ academic performance (81%), behavior and discipline (74%), and mental health (70%). A <a href="https://teachinglicense.study.com/featured-insights/mobile-bans-increase-engagement-and-learning-time.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">similar survey</a> from Study.com found teachers in schools with lenient cell phone policies are 21% more likely to lose more than an hour of learning time each week to managing cell phone use.</p>
<p>Last fall, 72% of U.S. high school teachers reported that students being distracted by their phones was a “major problem” in classrooms, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/06/12/72-percent-of-us-high-school-teachers-say-cellphone-distraction-is-a-major-problem-in-the-classroom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">study by Pew Research Center</a>. Around 33% of middle school teachers and 6% of elementary school teachers also said cell phone distractions are a major problem.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/mJo9Cqxr0DIJZBJpcZfzTEeGyF?domain=teachinglicense.study.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Study.com survey conducted between July 24 and August 6</a> determined that in schools with strict policies in effect, 70% of educators reported safer learning environments and 76% saw improved student engagement (see graphic). Additionally, 68% reported improved classroom management.</p>
<p>The survey also looked at schools with moderate or flexible cell phone policies and found those educators were 21% more likely to lose more than an hour of learning time each week to managing cell phone use.</p>
<p>“I’m always teaching to divided attention. There’s one eye on me, and one eye on the phone,” said Brandie Provenzano, a high school English teacher in Prince William County, Virginia. “When we tell them to put it away, it’s not like they’re defiant. They do put them away. But then you see them leaning over, trying to look in their backpack and read their messages, or they have to go to the bathroom to go read their messages.”</p>
<h3 id="cell-phone-bans-and-school-safety">Cell Phone Bans and School Safety</h3>
<p>Study.com’s summer survey also asked participants about how cell phone bans have impacted student and teacher safety.</p>
<p>Many teachers said they believe cell phone bans could increase student safety by decreasing school bullying and other behavioral disruptions. However, the study again found distinct differences in responses depending on whether a school has a flexible or strict cell phone policy.</p>
<p>In schools with flexible policies, 57% of educators said they believe a ban would enhance student safety. In comparison, 70% of educators in schools with strict policies said they believe bans would improve student safety.</p>
<p>The survey found similar patterns in the belief that bans improve teacher safety. In schools with flexible policies, 54% of teachers believe a cell phone ban would improve their safety. In schools with strict policies, 69% feel a cell phone ban improves their safety.</p>
<h3 id="lausd-san-mateo-foster-city-schools-report-cell-phone-ban-is-helping-student-achievement">LAUSD, San Mateo-Foster City Schools Report Cell Phone Ban Is Helping Student Achievement</h3>
<p>One school within the LAUSD, East Los Angeles Renaissance Academy, already implemented pouches last year. However, they allow students to keep the locked pouches on them instead of surrendering their phones to a central storage area.</p>
<p>“Still having the phone on them helps to lower the anxiety,” said Principal Francine Avila. “It’s a part of their body almost, and if you take it from them, you take the social-emotional component that goes with it.”</p>
<p>Within a few weeks of implementing the pouches, Avila said students were increasingly getting to class on time and participating more. School staff also started offering activities and sports during lunch to keep students engaged.</p>
<p><a data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="603fb249c323f39e54bbf9db" href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/schools-invest-in-cell-phone-lock-bags-to-curb-student-usage/130446/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">In the spring of 2022</a>, California’s San Mateo-Foster City School District purchased pouches for storing students’ cell phones. Before implementing the pouches at the district’s four middle schools, leaders held meetings with parents to reduce concerns about being unable to contact their children. Parents and guardians now call the school office when they need to reach their child.</p>
<p>SMFCSD Superintendent Diego Ochoa told NBC News that the pouches have been “an unquestioned success” and that students are paying more attention in class and talking to each other more outside of class.</p>
<h3 id="student-mental-health-and-cell-phones">Student Mental Health and Cell Phones</h3>
<p>While many mental health experts support a ban or limitation on cell phones, they also urge schools to look at other causes of distractions and other concerns such as bullying on social media.</p>
<p>“Just because we removed the phone from the environment doesn’t mean these issues are going to go away,” Anthony Vaccaro, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Southern California, told NBC.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/news/el-paso-middle-school-bans-all-black-clothing-cites-link-to-depression-crime/160915/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RELATED: El Paso Middle School Bans All-Black Clothing, Cites Link to Depression, Crime</a></h4>
<p>Jenkins said she sees a lot of negative effects of phone usage among children and teens but that it’s “not black and white.”</p>
<p>“It’s quite a nuanced discussion because not all children struggle with phone use,” she said. “But for those who do, we certainly are seeing the impacts in our mental health clinics and within psychiatry.”</p>
<p>Whether or not state or district leaders decide to enact laws or policies that limit or ban student cell phone use, including students and parents in the decision-making process is always a good idea, and recognizing that meaningful improvements in student wellness won’t happen with just one policy change.</p>
