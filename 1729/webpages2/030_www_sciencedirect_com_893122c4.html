                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>A worldwide movement to prohibit mobile phones in educational institutions has occurred, intending to diminish distractions, enhance concentration on academics, and promote positive social conduct. Initial findings from surveys indicate that such prohibitions could potentially boost scholastic achievement and lessen instances of bullying. Nevertheless, a crucial yet less-examined factor in comprehending the effects of phone bans involves the individual opinions and lived experiences of students regarding these regulations. This study was designed to fill that knowledge void by exploring student viewpoints concerning the advantages and disadvantages associated with mobile phone prohibitions in schools.</p>
                
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>The research involved a preregistered policy experiment carried out in five different high schools located in South Australia. In total, 7,188 answers to open-ended survey questions were furnished by 1,549 participating students.</p>
                
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>An analysis of 69,589 words of text using thematic methods revealed five distinct categories that contained 16 recurring themes. Regarding the negative consequences of the prohibitions, students conveyed: (i) a diminished sense of independence and trustworthiness, (ii) a loss of access to valuable digital educational resources, and (iii) challenges in managing their emotional distress in the absence of their phones. Conversely, students also noted positive outcomes in several domains, including: (i) direct, in-person social engagement, (ii) individual health and security, and (iii) active participation in the classroom. A number of students articulated a wish for instruction on the responsible use of phones, along with methods for managing digital devices that allow for flexibility and individual control, as a substitute for complete prohibitions.</p>
                
                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>The results of this study highlight the critical importance of observing and tackling students' excessive dependence on mobile phones for social interaction, emotional self-regulation, and dealing with mental health challenges. The perspectives offered by students provide significant contributions that can shape future policies and guidelines where digital technology intersects with student education and welfare.</p>
