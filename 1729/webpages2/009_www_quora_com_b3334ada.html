        <div class="answer-content">
            <p>One potential solution involves permitting smartphones on school grounds while students are prohibited from being present.</p>
            
            <p>An alternative approach is to permit both students and smartphones in schools, with the stipulation that the devices must not have batteries.</p>
            
            <p>Another strategy involves allowing students and smartphones on campus, but implementing restrictions that limit phone functionality to parental contact only.</p>
            
            <p>A different method involves downgrading smartphones to basic feature phones while simultaneously elevating the academic engagement of students.</p>
            
            <p>One could also arrange seating such that each male student sits beside a female student, and vice versa, which would likely serve as a significant distraction from their mobile devices.</p>
            
            <p>It is also possible to integrate artificial intelligence into each smartphone, programming it to verbally prompt the student to disengage from the device and refocus on the classroom lesson during instructional time.</p>
