        <article>
            <p>Aniya M., a member of the inaugural class of 64 ninth-grade students at the newly opened Cristo Rey Jesuit Seattle High School, had a general awareness of the institution's cellphone guidelines. The Seattle, Washington school, which opened its doors in August 2024, is a workplace for Katie Seltzer, Ed.M.’22. However, the full extent of the policy, which entails a complete ban on phones throughout the school day, became clear to her only after she received what she termed a “very polite” reminder to store her device while texting her mother during lunch, to avoid it being taken.</p>
            
            <p>Aniya, age 14, admits, “I was kind of shocked.” She explains that her decision to enroll at the Seattle campus, the latest addition to the 40-school Cristo Rey network of private, Catholic, college-preparatory institutions dedicated to serving students from low-income families, was driven by the “ton of opportunities for my future” it presented. (In accordance with the school's request, students are identified using only their first name and last initial.)</p>
            
            <p>Despite her initial surprise, she uncovered an unforeseen benefit of forgoing her phone within approximately a week. Aniya, who aspires to be a psychotherapist, states, “It is definitely helping me focus more in class.” She continues, “And it’s pushing me to reach out more to my peers instead of relying more on my phone, like I did in middle school. I have a bit of social anxiety so don’t like connecting with people. But the friends I’ve made are great, so I’m kind of glad we have that cellphone policy and we’re encouraged to talk to each other.”</p>
            
            <p>Her classmate, Sofia J., who has ambitions of becoming a pediatrician, was similarly not fully aware of the policy beforehand. “Now that I’m actually attending Cristo Rey, I feel the cellphone ban is beneficial,” she remarks. “I noticed I was participating more and engaging more in the classes I was taking. Even though I love using my phone, it’s not something I need during the school day. My education is more important.” Regarding making new friends, she emphasizes, “The in-person interactions are definitely more helpful than being on social media.”</p>
            
            <p>Elena J., who has plans to become a lawyer, selected Cristo Rey due to its demonstrated success in college acceptance rates and its distinctive model where students work one day per week at professional venues like Microsoft and the Space Needle via the Corporate Work Study program. “I felt an increase in focus because I don’t have to worry about my phone at all,” she says. She and her friends are so engaged with each other and their schoolwork that they do not miss their devices, she explains, adding, “I don’t see the need for [phones] in school for any reason. I read a study once on using phones during class, that it takes up to 20 minutes to focus back on the subject you’re doing in class. I feel like that is true.”</p>
            
            <p>Cristo Rey student Cole M., who aims to become a pediatrician, notes that while he personally is not distracted by smartphones, they can be a significant diversion for others, which is why he understands the regulation and has adapted to it with ease. Sincere B., another student who wants to be a mental health counselor, concurs that phone usage in class is detrimental because “you’re not really focused, and you won’t get any work done. At a school like Cristo Rey, you need to be doing the best you can so you can succeed.” While she expresses a desire to use her phone during breaks, she acknowledges that they are a distraction: “Even when I’m not at school, having my phone makes it harder for me to get up and do what I need to do.”</p>
            
            <p>When asked if other classmates are missing their phones or perhaps criticizing the policy, Aniya responds, “No, not really.” She elaborates, “It really doesn’t come up that often because we are encouraged to talk to each other more.”</p>
            
            <img src="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2024-11/cellphones-spot-illo-1.jpg" alt="Conceptual illustration of children in a cloud of digital information." />
            
            <p>It is true that the perspectives of five highly motivated ninth-grade students at one high school do not constitute a scientific survey. Nevertheless, these voices introduce a viewpoint that is not extensively covered in media discussions about phone bans: the perspective of the students themselves. None of the five students interviewed for this story objects to being without their mobile devices during class time. While a couple mentioned they would appreciate phone access during their lunch break, all of them conveyed a sense of relief, and even happiness, at not having to exercise self-control over a device that is as compelling (and, many would argue, addictive) as a portable mini-computer with full internet capabilities.</p>
            
            <h3>Reviewing the Evidence on School Phone Bans</h3>
            
            <p>Imagine if it were possible to create a school environment where students are concentrated on learning during instructional time, interacting fully with their peers during recess and lunch, and are liberated (at least for the duration of the school day) from cyberbullying, social media, text messages, video games, and other such distractions.</p>
            
            <p>The solution is straightforward: prohibit smartphones. This has become a widespread and increasingly popular trend.</p>
            
            <p>Data from the National Center for Education Statistics indicates that over 75% of public schools in the United States had banned cellphone use in some capacity during the 2021-22 academic year. In 2023, Florida was the first state to prohibit cellphone use during class time, although individual districts retain the authority to permit it during lunch and breaks. According to The <em>New York Times</em>, as of August 2024, eight additional states—Louisiana, South Carolina, Indiana, Virginia, Ohio, Minnesota, Delaware, and Pennsylvania—have enacted policies or legislation to reduce cellphone use in schools. New York Governor Kathy Hochul intends to introduce legislation in 2025 for a statewide ban on smartphones in schools, and in August 2024, California Governor Gavin Newsom encouraged school districts to restrict their use in classrooms. Other states, such as Oklahoma, Kansas, and Vermont, are also contemplating similar measures.</p>
            
            <p>This escalating movement across the nation is driven not just by the concerns of exasperated educators—a 2024 study by the Pew Research Center found that 72% of high school teachers view student distraction by cellphones as a major issue—but also by a compelling collection of research findings.</p>
            
            <p>A 2024 report from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health revealed that among middle school students in Norway, a recent cellphone ban resulted in a "significant decrease" in mental health issues for girls and an improvement in their academic grades. The ban also led to a reduction in bullying by more than 40% for both boys and girls. The report noted that these positive outcomes were even more pronounced for girls from backgrounds of lower socioeconomic status.</p>
            
            <p>The mere presence of a phone nearby is enough to distract students during class, as stated in UNESCO’s 2023 <em>Global Education Monitoring Report</em>. This report advises against using technology in classrooms, including smartphones, unless it directly supports learning objectives. As Elena J. recalled from a report she had read, it can indeed take up to 20 minutes for a student to regain focus on their studies after being distracted by a phone, whereas the removal of smartphones from the classroom has been shown to enhance learning, particularly for students who face academic challenges.</p>
            
            <p>In his 2024 bestselling book, <em>The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness</em>, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt makes a strong case for phone-free schools. He also argues that children should not own smartphones before entering high school or have access to social media before they turn 16. Furthermore, in June 2024, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy identified social media as a significant contributor to the current youth mental health crisis and called for a surgeon general’s warning to be placed on social media platforms. He also recommended that schools ensure social times, in addition to instructional periods, are kept free of phones to encourage students to engage with each other in person.</p>
            
            <p>With such a substantial amount of data supporting the advantages of phone-free schools, what are the arguments in favor of allowing them?</p>
            
            <p>A 2024 report by the National Parents Union indicates that 78% of parents believe their children should have access to their cellphones at certain times during the school day. In this tragic era of school shootings, a significant number of parents and students feel a greater sense of security knowing they can communicate with one another during a school emergency.</p>
            
            <p>“Schools regularly experience events that are scary, and parents want to communicate with their children at any time [in order to] make sure they are safe,” explains Victor Pereira, faculty co-chair of the Ed School’s Teaching and Teacher Leadership (TTL) Program. For parents, a total ban on cellphones “can be scary,” he states, “so schools have to consider how to alleviate that anxiety”—for instance, by reassuring parents that they can always contact the main office to get in touch with their child.</p>
            
            <p>Conversely, some believe that readily accessible cellphones could actually present a greater risk to students in such a crisis. “It shouldn’t be your top priority to use your phone during an emergency,” says student Elena J. “We’d just go all crazy calling our parents and we wouldn’t be paying attention to the teachers” who are attempting to ensure their safety.</p>
            
            <p>What is another challenge? Students, for whom smartphone use is as ubiquitous and seemingly inherent as breathing, might find it extremely difficult to manage without their devices. According to Common Sense Media, most teenagers spend over four hours a day on their smartphones and check them a median of 51 times daily, with some individuals doing so nearly 500 times a day. While mental health professionals debate whether excessive smartphone use constitutes a true addiction, there is no doubt that it can be very challenging to persuade kids—or anyone—to disregard their phones.</p>
            
            <p>Furthermore, is there a positive aspect lost by prohibiting phones at school? Can they not serve as a learning instrument that enriches education? And from a practical standpoint, how can educators establish an effective ban that yields the desired outcomes?</p>
            
            <h3>A Case Study: Implementing a No-Phone Policy</h3>
            
            <p>The educators who established Cristo Rey Jesuit Seattle recognized that they had a chance to conduct an experiment, one they were confident would significantly benefit their students.</p>
            
            <p>Unlike established schools that are attempting to introduce a new ban among students accustomed to having phones during class and breaks, “We have a rare opportunity to do things from the start, instead of doing a turnaround with cellphone bans,” states Seltzer, who holds the position of vice president of the school’s Corporate Work Study program.</p>
            
            <p>Across the dozens of Cristo Rey schools nationwide, 100% of graduates gain acceptance to four-year colleges, and their college graduation rate is double that of their socioeconomic peers, Seltzer reports, adding, “It’s a proven model and a successful model.”</p>
            
            <img src="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2024-11/cellphones-spot-illo-2.jpg" alt="Conceptual illustration of children enjoying the outdoors without digital devices." />
            
            <p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic had a profound effect on the educational journey of students globally, including the school’s first group of students, who were in elementary school when the pandemic began.</p>
            
            <p>As the school’s leadership team considered the most effective ways to help these students catch up academically, eliminating the distraction of phones appeared to be an obvious and achievable solution.</p>
            
            <p>“[We] need to ensure that our students continue to succeed in their college persistence, knowing they are often tasked with catchup work because they often haven’t had access to high-quality and rigorous education prior to coming to our schools,” Seltzer explains. “The impact on learning or productivity in the classroom or workplace is stark when every minute counts, particularly for students that haven’t had the same access to rigorous instruction that some students have access to.”</p>
            
            <p>The same principle applies to socialization. “If as soon as they leave the classroom, they pull out their phones, they’re not there in the hallway with their peers in the same way,” notes Seltzer, who is part of the school’s executive leadership team that made the decision to implement a no-phone policy. (It is important to note that not all Cristo Rey schools have such a policy.) “As a faith-based school, it is critical to our beliefs that we are a human family and to connect in person is the best way to create community.” A policy prohibiting phones “supports our goal in the uninterrupted focus on our classwork and our professional work in our work-study program.”</p>
            
            <p>Students at Cristo Rey Seattle are required to place their phones in their lockers in the morning and are not permitted to retrieve them until they depart for home. School leaders believe this policy not only helps students concentrate better in class but also encourages them to form genuine, in-person relationships during breaks and lunchtime.</p>
            
            <p>“This is rooted in research,” she underscores, pointing to the 2024 Norwegian public health report which highlights the disproportionately negative effects of smartphones in schools on girls from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>
            
            <p>The school began in August 2024 with a three-week summer session designed to equip students with the workplace skills needed for their corporate job placements. During this program, cellphones were not permitted. “We got some grumbles,” Seltzer recalls, with some students indicating they would like to have access during their lunch break. Seltzer views this reaction as a sign of success, “a concession of them realizing, ‘Maybe I don’t need it all day.’”</p>
            
            <p>Nevertheless, the school’s leaders are receptive to observing how the policy might be modified as the initial class of students adjusts and advances to higher grades. They may consider adjustments for students who show they can use phones responsibly. In the future, she says, “as our students grow and mature, we will be building opportunities to decide how to use [the phone] for executive functioning and calendaring.”</p>
            
            <h3>Alternative Perspectives: Phones as Educational Instruments</h3>
            
            <p>Louis Chugranis, who is currently enrolled in the Online Master’s in Education Program, would likely endorse that kind of adaptive approach. As a teacher since 2006—and currently a technology instructor at South Orangetown Middle School in Blauvelt, New York—Chugranis views the smartphone as “one of humankind’s great inventions,” which, when used appropriately, can serve as a valuable educational resource.</p>
            
            <p>Instead of advocating for a universal ban, Chugranis suggests, “I think we need to think more deliberately and intentionally about how to use smartphones in educational settings with our students.” While he acknowledges persistent concerns regarding cyberbullying and other adverse effects, he has also seen smartphones function as effective tools; for instance, allowing students in a design class to photograph architectural details of a building to model in their own projects.</p>
            
            <p>“If people are saying that smartphones should never be used in schools, I think that would be a myopic perspective,” he asserts. “The question is, how do we use smartphones in school with students in an educationally appropriate way while preventing all those other uses?” This is a challenge, he says, that we have not yet fully resolved.</p>
            
            <p>Chugranis expresses his hope to see thought leaders, including education experts at the Ed School, as well as neuroscientists, physicians, psychologists, parents, and students, collaborate to explore ways to maximize the benefits of smartphones for children while minimizing the potential harms.</p>
            
            <p>“I think the real problem is not should we use them or not, but how can we use them safely and appropriately to improve learning for students and to improve teaching, because obviously they can be used as powerful teaching devices,” he concludes.</p>
            
            <p>Cole M. also believes that smartphones can be beneficial in the classroom, particularly because school-issued laptops are often much slower when accessing educational applications and websites.</p>
            
            <p>Phones “also pose as a great communication tool between students and teachers,” he observes, “like if you want to know what to do on this assignment, or for impromptu class updates.” Yet, he admits he is “not quite sure” if the advantages ultimately outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
            
            <p>Pereira also holds the view that phones, when utilized correctly, can be a valuable resource due to the vast array of available educational apps and assessment tools. However, he stresses that whatever policy a school adopts, it must be applied consistently and equitably. He argues that the policy should be established at the administrative level, rather than being left to individual teachers to enforce, to prevent students from facing different rules in different classrooms. “That can be challenging for teachers to manage,” he notes.</p>
            
            <img src="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2024-11/ed-feature-cellphone-illo-2.jpg" alt="Conceptual illustration of a teacher with engaged students in a classroom." />
            
            <p>“We’ve heard over the last two to three years how hard it is for educators, that, ‘We did not choose to give your child a phone and we’re now in position of having to be the arbiter and manage it,’” explains Emily Weinstein, Ed.M.’14, Ed.D.’17. She is the co-founder and executive director of the Ed School’s new Center for Digital Thriving, a research center at Project Zero dedicated to fostering a nuanced understanding of technology in our lives. “Because of that, a top-down policy can feel to some teachers like a huge relief because they aren’t having to make decisions at the classroom level.”</p>
            
            <p>She recommends that administrators acknowledge this difficulty and actively listen to teachers as a key stakeholder group.</p>
            
            <h3>The Importance of Student Involvement in Policy-Making</h3>
            
            <p>Indeed, actively engaging and listening to all stakeholders is essential for creating a successful policy, assert Weinstein and Carrie James, who is the center’s managing director and co-founder. On matters concerning technology and the digital world, they place a high value on the opinions of young people. They note that too frequently in these conversations, including the debate over smartphones, adults formulate decisions without fully grasping the viewpoints of a younger generation for whom the digital realm is an integral part of life.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout the past decade, Weinstein and James have collaborated with thousands of students and hundreds of educators on topics related to digital technology. They are the co-authors of <em>Behind Their Screens: What Teens are Facing (and Adults are Missing)</em>, a book that incorporated the insights of 3,500 young people and subsequently inspired them to establish the center in the fall of 2023.</p>
            
            <p>For educators who are contemplating policies on smartphones and other technologies, they offer firm guidance based on their research: it is crucial to include students in the process. “We’re not for or against cellphone bans — we see a lot of wisdom in these efforts — but we’ve learned that schools that take the time to listen [to students] seem to end up in interesting places,” Weinstein says.</p>
            
            <p>For instance, they recommend conducting listening sessions before implementing new policies. It is advisable to survey students and parents about what is effective—or ineffective—with the current policy and to ask what they would want decision-makers to understand about the pros and cons of any proposed new policy, she suggests.</p>
            
            <p>“Carrie and I have found that a youth advisory is truly game changing,” Weinstein states, “because there are blind spots we have as adults.” She argues that without incorporating a youth perspective, “so often we end up missing the mark.”</p>
            
            <p>Through their work, they have discovered from young people “that sometimes adding is as important as subtracting,” Weinstein explains. “So, if you’re subtracting cellphones, it’s a natural opportunity to consider what you might need to introduce so you are enriching students’ experiences.” For example, one school installed tetherball sets on its playground. “Or you could add board games in the cafeteria, or you may hear what additional supports students need to feel safe” without their phones.</p>
            
            <p>By soliciting input from the community, educators gain the chance to comprehend the underlying reasons for any opposition to new regulations; for instance, a student might disclose that they require a phone because they are responsible for a younger sibling. “That doesn’t mean you can’t go to a policy like a cellphone ban, but it means creating ways for communities to give feedback before the ban occurs or at least as you’re gearing up for it,” Weinstein says. She also recommends communicating to both parents and students how their concerns are being addressed.</p>
            
            <p>Another valuable insight they have gained is that when introducing new technology policies, “consistency in the early weeks of school makes a big difference,” she says—similar to the courteous reminder Aniya received to put her phone away when she was texting her mother as a new student at Cristo Rey. Although the policy has required some adjustment, when Aniya is asked if she enjoys her new school, she smiles widely and confirms, “Yes, very much.”</p>
