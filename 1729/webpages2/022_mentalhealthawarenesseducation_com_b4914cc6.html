		<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clarifying the Concept of a Smartphone 'Ban' in Schools</h2>
		<p>Should cellphones be permitted within the classroom setting? To be precise, the discussion centers on smartphones—devices that provide internet access and social media applications—as they represent the primary threat to healthy development and academic learning.</p>
		<p>Based on the extensive data showing the detrimental effects of smartphone and social media use on young people<sup>1</sup>, it is apparent that schools must become smartphone-free zones during school hours to optimize student learning.<sup>2</sup></p>
		<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
			<p><em><strong>Psychologist Jonathan Haidt, author of <a href="https://amzn.to/4fg9Uad">The Anxious Generation</a>, argues that kids between the ages of 9 and 15 are particularly susceptible to the harmful effects of social media.<sup>3</sup></strong></em></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The majority of children use their phones to access social media. It is understood that this age group is undergoing a critical phase of brain development, making them more vulnerable to the content they encounter in an online environment that lacks sufficient safeguards and contains malicious entities aiming to manipulate young individuals for financial gain. With my background as a former digital marketing business owner and specialist, I am aware of the extensive measures social media companies employ to maintain youth engagement on their platforms, investing hundreds of millions to achieve this.</p>
		<p>My proposal is not that students should simply place their smartphones in their pockets on silent mode, where they continue to vibrate, nor do I suggest they just be turned off.</p>
		<p>These devices remain overly accessible, and students will inevitably find ways to bypass such rules, as the allure of peer interaction or social media validation is exceptionally powerful.</p>
		<p>It is necessary to implement a system similar to that used at concerts, where phones are secured in a locked pouch at the start of the school day, a process that admittedly requires effort. After such a policy is in place, time and resources would become available to involve School Resource Officers (SROs) in managing this procedure. I am confident they would be supportive, considering a significant portion of school-related issues they handle are connected to smartphone use.</p>
		<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="712" src="https://mentalhealthawarenesseducation.com/wp-content/uploads/image-playbook-mentally-healthy-students-1024x712.png" alt="An image showing a playbook for creating mentally healthy students and a positive school culture." class="wp-image-15601" style="width:595px;height:auto" /></figure>
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reframing the Policy: Beyond the Term 'Ban'</h2>
		<p>For our objectives, perhaps we should avoid the term "ban," as it can carry punitive connotations. Alternative phrasing could be "<em><strong>Unplugged for Mental Health &amp; Learning</strong></em>" or "<strong><em>Smartphone-Free School</em></strong>." These are merely suggestions, because the students, not the adults, should be the ones to name this experiment.</p>
		<p>I anticipate some resistance to this idea.</p>
		<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some contend that restricting mobile phones will heighten their desirability, much like alcohol during the Prohibition era.</strong></h4>
		<p>This approach, however, does not advocate for complete prohibition but rather for a temporary break. It is beneficial to establish a student advisory board to ensure they are invested in the experiment, preventing them from feeling that the rule is being imposed upon them.</p>
		<p>We could solicit their opinions on the potential adverse and beneficial results of spending time away from their devices. You might be surprised to find that some students feel a sense of relief, even if they are hesitant to express this openly among their peers.</p>
		<p>Following a trial period of about a month, it would be essential to conduct a survey to gather their feedback.</p>
		<ul class="wp-block-list">
			<li>What was the experience like?</li>
			<li>What were the negative aspects?</li>
			<li>What were the positive aspects?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This could even culminate in a panel discussion or a formal debate on the topic, allowing both sides to present their cases. Decisions could then be made based on these outcomes.</p>
		<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An additional argument against smartphone restrictions is that these devices could be utilized to support educational objectives.</strong></h4>
		<p>These are personal devices, and our educational curricula have not yet advanced to a stage where their integration is practical. At present, they primarily function as a source of distraction and do not contribute to a conducive learning atmosphere.</p>

		<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding Parental Objections to Cellphone-Free School Policies</h2>
		<p>Despite a significant body of evidence indicating that mobile phones contribute to numerous youth mental health challenges, some parents have resisted the idea of limiting phone access in schools.</p>
		<p>The most frequent reason I hear from parents is the concern over school shootings or other potential tragedies and acts of violence.</p>
		<p>Parents desire the reassurance of an instant message confirming their child's safety, which is an understandable sentiment. As a mother myself, I recognize that we reside in a nation where the fear of school shootings and violence is pervasive.</p>
		<p>Initially, it is important to recognize that while school shootings are highly publicized by the media and understandably command national attention, they remain statistically infrequent events.</p>
		<p>A child's likelihood of being harmed or killed by falling debris is greater than their chance of being a victim in a school shooting. This is not to diminish the importance of preparedness, but it raises the question of how a child possessing a phone at school actually prevents them from being harmed.</p>
		<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Statement from Deputy David Gomez:</h3>
		<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
			<p><em><strong>“Cellphones are a drug, and kids are wired to get addicted,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/deputygomez/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Idaho’s Boise County Sheriff Deputy Dave Gomez </a>says. I now strongly advise against children under the age of 13 having smartphones. I’ve seen too many 9 to 11-year-olds making life-altering decisions on social media platforms they shouldn’t be using. Additionally, numerous parents have expressed to me their surprise at the extent of trouble their young children can encounter online. If we want our kids to learn, we have to take away those cell phones.”</strong></em></p>
		</blockquote>
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Desire for In-School Phones Is a Response to Parental Fears</h2>
		<p>But what is the ultimate price of this reassurance?</p>
		<p><strong>Are our fears of a potential school shooting so great that we are willing to sacrifice our children’s mental, psychosocial, and academic development for the convenience of contacting them for a dentist appointment or in the aftermath of a disaster that has not happened?</strong> It is worth considering that this primarily serves to alleviate parental anxiety.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, cell phones (specifically smartphones) contribute to the loneliness epidemic<sup>4</sup> and diminish opportunities for children to develop coping mechanisms. This occurs because the mobile phone acts as a crutch, allowing them to avoid uncomfortable face-to-face interactions, which in turn means fewer chances to cultivate resilience. Children today are not acquiring the valuable coping skills that come from navigating awkward and imperfect social situations.</p>
		<p>If you were to <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7lziPqBEbw?si=Hp9Ixgk98vGDe7mS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut open a cocoon to spare a caterpillar the effort of emerging as a butterfly, you would ultimately deprive it of its capacity to fly</a>. The very act of struggling to break free from the cocoon is what strengthens the butterfly's wings by forcing fluid into them, making flight possible.<sup>5</sup></p>

		<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nine Critical Reasons for Implementing Smartphone-Free Policies in K-12 Schools:</h2>
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>How Phones Serve as a Major Distraction to Learning</strong></h2>
		<p>To ensure children can learn effectively, it is essential to prohibit smartphones in educational settings.</p>
		<ul class="wp-block-list">
			<li><strong>Disruptions in the classroom</strong>: Cell phones cause interruptions to instruction when students receive notifications, text messages, and calls during class time. Even when not in active use, the vibration of a phone creates a temptation to check it, which redirects focus away from the learning process.</li>
			<li><strong>Problems with multitasking</strong>: Students may attempt to multitask by sending texts, playing games, or using social media during class, which compromises their capacity to concentrate on the lesson, retain information, and engage in classroom activities.</li>
		</ul>
		<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">
			<blockquote>
				<p><em>“I have been working in a high school for the past year, and I can tell you, as boots on the ground, in the middle of this debate, that there is a marked improvement in everything from learning to mental health. Last school year, we did not have any real policy around mobile technology. Fast forward to this fall, where we implemented a no cell phone during instruction policy. This has been a game-changer.”&nbsp;</em></p>
				<cite>Kristen, On Staff at a High School in the USA</cite>
			</blockquote>
		</figure>
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>How Mobile Phones Encourage Addictive Behaviors</strong></h2>
		<ul class="wp-block-list">
			<li><strong>Screen Addiction</strong><sup>6</sup>: Attempting to take a phone away can provoke a severe tantrum in some children. Enforcing a mandatory break from the phone with the explanation, "This is out of my control; it's the rule," can alleviate pressure on you. Reduced screen time compels them to engage their minds more actively and also limits the exposure and associated mental health risks that come with unrestricted phone access.</li>
			<li><strong>Other Forms of Addiction: </strong>An addiction to screens can pave the way for other dependencies, such as drug addiction and gambling. Sports betting among university students is one of the most rapidly expanding addictions. My son, Charles, utilized his cell phone at school to arrange drug purchases and to sell illegal alcohol at parties for money to support his escalating substance abuse, which eventually developed into a heroin addiction. Increased time spent on phones elevates the risk of engaging in harmful activities.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Negative Effects on Academic Performance</strong></h2>
		<ul class="wp-block-list">
			<li><strong>Phones contribute to lower academic results:</strong> Research indicates that students who use their phones during class generally achieve poorer academic outcomes. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425970/#:~:text=While%20teachers%20and%20parents%20are,not%20%5B8%2C9%5D." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>“<strong>Students who used their phones in class took fewer notes [7] and had poorer overall academic performance, compared to those who did not</strong>.</em></a><sup>7</sup>” The presence of phones can disrupt both the immediate comprehension and the long-term recall of information.</li>
			<li><strong>Diminishes problem-solving abilities</strong>: Uninterrupted access to information through cell phones can discourage students from participating in more profound thought processes and problem-solving. In essence, these devices impede the cultivation of critical thinking in adolescents, which is a vital skill for developing the resilience and coping strategies necessary for their futures.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. The Rise of Cyberbullying and Harassment</strong><sup>8</sup></h2>
		<p>It is improbable that parents have been more successful at preventing cyberbullying at home than schools have been, yet parents frequently criticize schools for not taking more action. While this may be valid in some instances, a significant amount of harmful activity occurs on the mobile phones that parents provide to their children, who need a respite from constant, 24/7 harassment. <a href="https://mentalhealthawarenesseducation.com/what-age-should-kids-get-a-phone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They also require clear boundaries</a>. No educational institution can effectively monitor all the content that children access on these devices.</p>
		<ul class="wp-block-list">
			<li><strong>Elevated risk of bullying</strong>: Cell phones provide an easier means for students to either participate in or be subjected to cyberbullying. Through these devices, they can send or receive malicious messages, propagate rumors, or distribute inappropriate images.</li>
			<li><strong>Exclusion from social groups</strong>: The use of social media and text messaging can foster the formation of cliques and exclusionary practices, leading students to feel compelled to uphold a specific online image, which in turn intensifies anxiety and peer pressure. Additionally, there is the threat of <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams/sextortion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sextortion</a>, a type of child sexual exploitation in which a young person is blackmailed, often with the threat of publicly sharing their sexual images, by an individual who demands more sexual content, sexual acts, or money from the child.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Worsening Mental Health Issues</strong><sup>1</sup></h2>
		<ul class="wp-block-list">
			<li><strong>Anxiety and depression</strong>: The overuse of cell phones, particularly for social media, has been correlated with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and feelings of loneliness among students <sup>1, 4</sup>. Persistent social comparison, the pressure to conform, the fear of missing out (FOMO), and exposure to online criticism can all adversely affect mental wellness.</li>
			<li><strong>Interference with sleep</strong>: Students who have phones at school might stay awake late at night using them, which can disrupt their sleep cycles, resulting in tiredness, decreased focus, and diminished academic results. They require a period of rest from these devices.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Facilitating Cheating and Academic Dishonesty</strong></h2>
		<ul class="wp-block-list">
			<li><strong>Makes cheating easier</strong>: Cell phones offer straightforward access to information during exams and quizzes, making it possible for students to find answers or distribute them to their classmates. This practice compromises academic integrity and the integrity of evaluations.</li>
			<li><strong>Plagiarism concerns</strong>: Students might use their phones to copy and paste text or concepts from online sources without giving proper credit, which further promotes academic dishonesty.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Potential Safety and Security Risks</strong></h2>
		<ul class="wp-block-list">
			<li><strong>Diminished focus during emergencies</strong>: In an emergency situation, students might become distressed and try to reach their parents on their phones rather than adhering to the school's established emergency procedures. This can lead to disorder, obstruct evacuation processes, or aggravate the situation.</li>
			<li><strong>Theft and potential damage</strong>: The presence of cell phones in schools can elevate the risk of theft, damage, or loss of personal items, which may result in disputes among students, parents, and the school administration.</li>
			<li><strong>Online threats: </strong>It is estimated that 40 percent of victims of sex trafficking are recruited through the internet, establishing it as the most prevalent method of recruitment.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Impeding Social and Emotional Growth</strong></h2>
		<ul class="wp-block-list">
			<li><strong>Diminished social engagement</strong>: When students are engrossed in their phones during breaks and unstructured time, it curtails their opportunities for face-to-face communication and the cultivation of crucial social skills. This can negatively impact their capacity to communicate proficiently and form substantial relationships. Consider how many young people you know are capable of maintaining eye contact with an adult.</li>
			<li><strong>Over-reliance on technology</strong>: Permitting continuous phone access can foster a dependency on technology as the main vehicle for communication and leisure, which may inhibit creativity and the development of independent thought.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. Highlighting the Digital Divide Instead of Promoting Equal Access and Equity</strong></h2>
		<ul class="wp-block-list">
			<li><strong>Unequal access</strong>: Not every student has access to the newest or most sophisticated smartphones. Those without may experience feelings of exclusion or disconnection, which can create a perception of inequality among their peers. It is well-established that a sense of connection and belonging is essential for positive mental health and well-being.</li>
			<li><strong>Financial burden</strong>: The expectation for students to own a phone to maintain contact or access educational resources can create a financial burden for families, especially for those with low incomes. (These devices often cost significantly more than trendy clothing or jeans.)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. Creating a Distraction from School Policies and Objectives</strong></h2>
		<ul class="wp-block-list">
			<li><strong>Interference with school regulations</strong>: Schools typically enforce clear guidelines regarding acceptable conduct and the use of technology. Cell phones can present a challenge to these regulations, resulting in disagreements between students and faculty or administrators.</li>
			<li><strong>Weakening the school's culture</strong>: An excessive reliance on phones can weaken a school's culture of active participation, mutual respect, and focus, as students may become more withdrawn and less motivated to engage in school-related functions.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Implementing smartphone-free policies in K-12 schools has been demonstrated to address these challenges, helping to create a more concentrated, fair, and socially interactive educational setting.</p>

						<p>Every comment in support of “Don’t bring the cell phone to school is correct.” I go deeper. I have completed research on this element of the problem. It is only one element, but it is based on fundamentals that do not change. I don’t vote on gravity. I don’t vote on the fundamentals of human connection.</p>
						<p>The cell phone has broken the most essential and sacred element of who we are as humans. Connection with ourselves is first and the most essential. Then almost as important is connection with those about us. Especially those who differ from us in some area. You cannot love others more than you love yourself. The cell phone has broken our love for ourselves. How far broken? I fear to where our self love is nearly zero. </p>
						<p>I know of one solution. It is simple. But it is hard, Do not go past this boundary. Thar be dragons out thar. Leave the cell phone at home in a drawer.</p>
						<p>Don’t tell me you need it call your uncle to come to school and pick you up. I grew up with a phone on the wall had a hand crank ringer on the side. I never needed to call anyone. Everyone knew when school was out. Even watches on children were non-existent. But all the adults knew what time it was. And children knew when school was out. The teacher said “dismissed.”</p>
						<p>All those are essential elements of connection then and now. Leave the cell phones at home in a drawer. Hard line. Do not cross. Dragons don’t care, so you must care.</p>
