    <hr />

    <p>The movement to ban or restrict cell phones within K-12 schools is continuing to build momentum during the current academic year. A report from Ballotpedia indicates that by June 2025, legislation or policies governing student cell phone use in K-12 classrooms have been signed or implemented in 22 states and Washington, D.C.</p>
    <p>On a more localized basis, numerous school boards and districts have independently voted to prohibit or limit cell phones in classrooms, with some taking this action before it was mandated by their state. As an example, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) School Board approved a measure in June 2024 to prohibit the use of cell phones and social media throughout the school day.</p>
    <p>Under the LAUSD policy that commenced on February 18, students are required to power off their phones and store them away, as silent or vibrate modes are not permitted. The use of phones is prohibited during lunch and break periods, although students may use them on campus prior to the start and after the end of school hours.</p>
    <p>A 2023 report by Common Sense Media reveals that 50 percent of children aged 11 to 17 get a minimum of 237 phone notifications daily, with a quarter of these alerts arriving during school hours. Over the last year, many school districts have initiated lawsuits against the parent corporations of Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube, claiming their applications contribute to classroom discipline issues, mental health challenges, and a diversion of educational resources.</p>
    
    <h2>The Rationale Behind School Cell Phone Restrictions</h2>
    <p>Beyond the evident issue of cell phones causing major learning distractions, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy released an advisory in June urging Congress to mandate warning labels on social media platforms concerning their impact on youth. This advisory stated that social media has the potential to create body image problems, influence eating habits and sleep patterns, and result in social comparison and diminished self-esteem. Data from the Pew Research Center in 2022 shows that over one-third of teenagers between 13 and 17 report using social media "almost constantly," which includes usage during school hours.</p>

    <h2>Which States Have Active Laws or Executive Orders Banning or Restricting School Cell Phone Use?</h2>
    <p>To be specific, what states have passed official legislation or issued executive orders that prohibit cell phones in educational institutions? By June 2025, the following states, along with Washington, D.C., have such measures in place:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Alabama</li>
        <li>Florida</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
        <li>Indiana</li>
        <li>Iowa</li>
        <li>Kentucky</li>
        <li>Louisiana</li>
        <li>Nebraska</li>
        <li>Nevada</li>
        <li>New York</li>
        <li>North Dakota</li>
        <li>Oklahoma</li>
        <li>South Carolina</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Arkansas</li>
        <li>Arizona</li>
        <li>California</li>
        <li>Ohio</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AP News reports that as of May 2025, legislation to ban cell phones is also under consideration in these states:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Illinois</li>
        <li>Maine</li>
        <li>Massachusetts</li>

        <li>North Carolina</li>
        <li>Vermont</li>
        <li>Wisconsin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mississippi and Wyoming are the only states that have yet to implement any policies regarding cell phone usage in schools. A comprehensive overview is available in the chart from AP News provided below. (Please note: This chart was last updated on May 21 and therefore does not list Texas as having a statewide ban or restriction.)</p>

    <h2>What was the First State to Implement a Cell Phone Ban?</h2>
    <p>Governor Ron DeSantis signed House Bill 379 into law in May 2023, establishing Florida as the first state to prohibit cell phones in classrooms through a legislative act. The bill received unanimous approval from both chambers of the state legislature.</p>
    <p>The legislation specifies, "While a student is permitted to have a wireless communications device on school grounds or at a school event, its use is forbidden during instructional periods unless a teacher explicitly allows it for educational reasons." The bill also mandates, "During instructional time, a teacher must assign a specific area for wireless devices. Every district school board is required to create regulations for student use of these devices on school property or at school-sponsored events."</p>
    <p>Beyond prohibiting cell phones in classrooms, House Bill 379 further obligates schools to restrict social media access on their computers and Wi-Fi, with exceptions for educational use and for instructing students in grades 6-12 on social media risks.</p>

    <h2>Details of Indiana's School Cell Phone Prohibition</h2>
    <p>Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb approved Senate Bill 185 in March 2024, which prohibits the use of cell phones and other mobile devices like laptops and tablets during class time. This bill passed in the Indiana House with a vote of 83-8 and was unanimously approved by the Senate with a 49-0 vote.</p>
    <p>The bill's text states, "Every school corporation and charter school must adopt and enforce a policy on wireless communication devices that: (1) forbids student use of such devices during instruction, with specific exceptions; (2) allows teachers to authorize student use of a device for educational activities during class; and (3) allows students to use a device during an emergency or for managing their health."</p>

    <h2>Louisiana's School Cell Phone Ban Details</h2>
    <p>In May 2024, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry signed Senate Bill 207, which bans cell phones for the entire instructional day. This bill became effective for the current school year.</p>
    <p>The bill states, "...no student shall possess, on his person, an electronic telecommunication device throughout the instructional day." It continues, "If a student brings an electronic telecommunication device in any public elementary or secondary school building or on the grounds thereof during an instructional day, the electronic device shall either be turned off and properly stowed away for the duration of the instructional day or prohibited from being turned on and used during the instructional day."</p>

    <h2>South Carolina's School Cell Phone Ban</h2>
    <p>South Carolina lawmakers included a proviso in the 2024-2025 state budget in July 2024 that mandates schools to ban student cell phone use during the day in order to receive funding.</p>
    <p>The provision says, "To receive state funds allocated for State Aid to Classrooms, a school district shall implement a policy adopted by the State Board of Education that prohibits access to personal electronic communication devices by students during the school day." It clarifies, "For purposes of this provision, a personal electronic communication device is considered to be a device not authorized for classroom use by a student, utilized to access the Internet, Wi-Fi, or cellular telephone signals."</p>

    <h2>California Governor Signs Phone-Free Schools Act</h2>
    <p>On September 23, 2024, Governor Gavin Newsom signed the Phone-Free Schools Act, which mandates that every school district, charter school, and county office of education must create a policy to limit smartphone use during school hours. This law is scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2026.</p>
    <p>Newsom had initially signed AB 272 into law in 2019, which affirmed that school districts possess the authority to regulate smartphone use during school hours. He later announced in June his intentions to restrict smartphone usage throughout the school day.</p>
    <p>“As the Surgeon General affirmed, social media is harming the mental health of our youth,” he declared in a statement. “I look forward to working with the Legislature to restrict the use of smartphones during the school day. When children and teens are in school, they should be focused on their studies — not their screens.”</p>
    <p>After Newsom's announcement in June, the California School Boards Association stated its position that any rules over student cell phone use should be determined by individual school districts. “We support legislation which empowers school leaders to make policy decisions at a local level that reflect their community’s concerns and what’s necessary to support their students,” said Troy Flint, a spokesperson for the association.</p>
    <p>The new law incorporates some flexibility. For instance, schools are not permitted to stop a student from using a smartphone if a doctor confirms it is needed for health reasons, and some students in individualized education programs might be exempted from the restrictions. Students will also be permitted to access their cell phones during emergencies; however, districts have the authority to define what situations qualify as an emergency and how smartphones may be used.</p>

    <h2>New York Governor Signed ‘Bell to Bell’ Cell Phone Ban</h2>
    <p>In January 2025, New York Governor Kathy Hochul introduced a plan to limit smartphone use in schools across the state, beginning with the 2025-2026 academic year. The legislative proposal specifies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No unauthorized use of smartphones and other personal devices with internet capability will be allowed on K-12 school grounds for the entire school day, covering classroom time as well as other periods like lunch and study hall.</li>
        <li>It permits schools to create their own methods for storing smartphones during the day, which offers administrators and teachers the flexibility to choose what is most effective for their schools and students.</li>
        <li>The plan proposes $13.5 million in funding to be accessible for schools requiring help to buy storage options that will assist them in becoming distraction-free.</li>
        <li>It also requires schools to provide a method for parents to contact their children during the day if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Governor Hochul announced on May 6, 2025, that New York is set to become the largest state in the U.S. to mandate "bell-to-bell" restrictions on smartphones. This policy is slated to begin in the fall for the 2025-2026 academic year.</p>

    <h2>Georgia Cell Phone Ban Doesn’t Include High Schoolers</h2>
    <p>Georgia passed a bill in March 2025 that prohibits all personal electronic devices for students in kindergarten through 8th grade. The "Distraction-Free Education Act" requires that students keep their devices out of view, with exceptions for those with IEPs or medical requirements. This ban is set to begin in July 2026.</p>
    <p>“This is a not just an academic bill,” Republican Representative Scott Hilton stated after the bill's passage. “This is a mental health bill. It’s a public safety bill.”</p>

    <h2>Arizona's School Cell Phone Ban</h2>
    <p>In April 2025, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs signed HB 2484, a bill that requires districts to restrict cell phone use during school hours. The law instructs districts to formulate policies regarding cell phone use and to communicate them to parents at the start of every school year.</p>

    <h2>North Dakota's School Cell Phone Ban</h2>
    <p>Also in April 2025, North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong signed a bell-to-bell prohibition on student cellphone use. This law mandates that school districts establish a policy where all personal electronic devices must be silenced or powered off, securely stored, and kept inaccessible to students.</p>
    <p>“This is a game changer for our public schools, giving students the freedom to focus on learning and to interact with teachers and friends without the constant tug of their cell phones and addictive social media,” Armstrong stated in a news release.</p>
    <p>The law is scheduled to take effect for the 2025-26 school year.</p>

    <h2>Oklahoma's School Cell Phone Ban</h2>
    <p>Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed into law a yearlong prohibition on student cellphone use in all public schools in May 2025, as reported by the Oklahoma Voice. Governor Stitt signed Senate Bill 139 on May 6, which puts the "bell to bell" ban in place for the 2025-26 school year. For the subsequent year, the restriction will become optional for school districts.</p>
    <p>While the ban is active, each district's school board is required to adopt a policy that prevents students from using cellphones, laptops, tablets, smart watches, smart headphones, and smart glasses from the first bell to dismissal. The law still permits school-issued or school-approved devices for classroom instruction, and districts are allowed to permit cellphone use for emergencies or for students with medical requirements.</p>

    <h2>Alabama Governor Signs Cell Phone Ban Bill, Requires Social Media Training for 8th Graders</h2>
    <p>Also during May 2025, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey signed the Freeing Our Classrooms of Unnecessary Screens for Safety (FOCUS) Act into law, which forbids students from using smartphones and other wireless devices within Alabama's public schools.</p>
    <p>The FOCUS Act also mandates that the Alabama State Department of Education must provide social media training to all students before they enter the eighth grade.</p>
    <p>“According to a recent survey, 72% of high school teachers in the country reported that cell phones are distracting students,” Ivey stated. “We have also learned from parents that teens are spending an average of almost five hours every day on social media, and it is having a negative impact on their well-being.”</p>

    <h2>Nebraska Governor Bans Cell Phones Throughout School Day</h2>
    <p>On May 20, 2025, Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen signed Legislative Bill 140, which prohibits students from using cell phones on school grounds. Another bill signed by Pillen, LB 383, necessitates that social media companies verify the age of users when they register, ABC 8 reports. Any individual under 18 will require parental permission to open an account.</p>

    <h2>Washington, D.C. Issues Bell-to-Bell Cell Phone Ban</h2>
    <p>District of Columbia Public Schools announced on June 6, 2025, that the district will implement a bell-to-bell personal cell phone ban policy starting the next school year. Phones will need to be turned off and put away during school hours.</p>
    <p>The district reports that all of DCPS’s middle schools and a number of its high schools have already put the ban into effect and are observing positive outcomes.</p>
    <p>“Piloting a phone-free program in our middle schools demonstrated that storing students’ personal devices throughout the school day enriches academic, social, and emotional learning,” stated DCPS Chancellor, Dr. Lewis D. Ferebee. “From increased classroom engagement to reduced anxiety and stronger student relationships—DCPS is ready to scale the program so we can keep driving outcomes that positively impact our students.”</p>
    <p>Individual schools will have the responsibility to create an approach to the policy "that best fits the specific needs of their communities."</p>

    <h2>Texas Governor Signs Bill Banning Cell Phones in School</h2>
    <p>Most recently, on June 20, 2025, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 1481, which requires public school districts and open-enrollment charter schools to adopt and enforce policies that forbid students from using "personal communication devices" during school hours.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the bill, schools must either forbid students from bringing devices onto campus or devise a method for students to store them while on school premises. Schools are also mandated to establish consequences for students who are discovered using the devices. However, exceptions will be permitted if a student has a doctor's note or if a device is necessary to meet health or safety standards.</p>
    <p>Back in September, Texas Education Agency (TEA) Commissioner Mike Morath had urged lawmakers to enact a ban in public schools throughout the state, stating that cell phones are "extremely harmful" to student learning.</p>
    <p>“If it were in my power, I would have already banned them in all schools in the state,” he remarked. “So I would encourage you to consider that as a matter of public policy going forward for our students and our teachers.”</p>
    <p>The House passed the bill with a vote of 128 to 17, with two members not voting. The Senate approved the bill with a 31 to 0 vote. School boards have been given a 90-day period to adopt the policy.</p>

    <h2>Virginia Governor Issues Executive Order on Cell Phones in Schools</h2>
    <p>While not a formal law, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin issued Executive Order 33 in July 2024 to "help bring cell-phone-free education to Virginia schools."</p>
    <p>The order directs to "Establish a detailed definition of ‘cell phone-free education’ which incorporates feedback from parents, students, teachers, and other stakeholders." It further specifies, "The definition should address the age-appropriateness of all actions including the elimination or severe restriction of the use of cell phones and smart phones during instructional time, as well as input on age-appropriate restrictions on other personal electronic communication devices, such as smart watches, tablets, and computers connected to the internet during instructional time other than school authorized uses."</p>
    <p>Youngkin tasked the Department of Education with developing the guidelines, which were officially released on September 17. The document, titled “Guidance for Cell Phone-Free Education Pursuant to Executive Order 33,” prohibits students from using cell phones for the entire day, which includes lunch and free periods between classes. The decision on whether students can keep their phones in their backpacks or must store them in a locker or locked pouch is left to the discretion of school districts.</p>
    <p>High school students in Virginia are permitted to use their phones on school property before or after the school day. Elementary students who bring phones to school are not allowed to use them on school grounds, but middle school students may use their phones before or after school, based on the policy established by the local school division.</p>

    <h3>Alexandria City Public Schools Adds Smartwatches to Cell Phone Ban Policy</h3>
    <p>A recent Study.com survey indicates that 50% of teachers feel smartwatches are now being used as a substitute for cell phones in classrooms. An additional 40% have noted a rise in smartwatch use since cell phone prohibitions were enacted.</p>
    <p>The same study revealed that 60% of teachers identified texting as the primary problem associated with smartwatches, and 60% of those surveyed also reported that students play games or use apps on their smartwatches during class.</p>
    <p>When students at Alexandria City Public Schools (ACPS) came back to class on January 2 after winter break, they were also prohibited from using their smartwatches. The ACPS School Board voted 8-1 last month to broaden its ban on electronic devices to encompass smartwatches, as reported by WUSA. All electronic devices are required to be stored in backpacks, lockers, or a specified area within the classroom. Students are permitted to use devices on school buses during their commute to and from school, and while traveling between campuses. The updated policy stipulates that students could face suspension or expulsion if they are caught using smartwatches in class.</p>
    <p>During the meeting on December 19, student representatives voiced the difficulties of the ban, pointing out that they observe teachers and other adults using their phones inside school buildings.</p>
    <p>“What we’re asking you to do is hard. It would be hard for any of us. I acknowledge that this is a tough ask. But I want something better for you, and I think this is an important step in improving your educational environment,” board member Dr. Ashley Simpson Baird stated in reply. “For me, this is coming from a place of improving the quality of your education when you’re with us.”</p>
    <p>ACPS Superintendent Melanie Kay-Wyatt stressed the school's duty regarding student safety and communication with parents.</p>
    <p>“I think the goal is about the safety. I want to say to parents, let us manage the inside of that facility to ensure that it’s safe,” she commented. “If there’s a matter or something that they need to get to their child, a message or something, there’s always the office who could take care of that matter for them.”</p>

    <h2>Ohio Legislation Limits Cell Phone Usage</h2>
    <p>Although it is not a statewide prohibition, Ohio passed a law that restricts cell phone use in classrooms. Governor Mike DeWine signed House Bill 250 in May 2024, which mandates that districts create policies on cell phone use in schools.</p>
    <p>The bill states, "...each school district board of education shall adopt a policy governing the use of cellular telephones by students during school hours." It continues, "The policy shall do all of the following: (1) Emphasize that student cellular telephone use be as limited as possible during school hours; (2) Reduce cellular telephone-related distractions in classroom settings..."</p>
    <p>The bill was unanimously passed by both the Ohio House and the Senate.</p>
    <p>School districts throughout Ohio have started to formulate and enact their cell phone ban policies. As an example, Toledo Public Schools (TPS) will mandate that students store their cell phones in secure pouches or lockboxes during school hours starting in August 2025.</p>

    <h2>4 States Encourage Districts to Limit Student Cell Phone Use</h2>
    <p>Other states are actively encouraging schools to establish policies, though the decision is at their own discretion. These states are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Connecticut</li>
        <li>Kansas</li>
        <li>Oregon</li>
        <li>Washington</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In August 2024, the Connecticut State Board of Education also voted unanimously to approve a policy that encourages districts to restrict student access to cell phones during school hours.</p>
    <p>“Given the risks and negative impact on learning and mental health, local and regional boards of education, in collaboration with school leaders, educators, families and students, should develop and enact a districtwide Personal Technology Use in Schools policy inclusive of cell phones and current and emerging technologies,” the board declared in a statement.</p>
    <p>Governor Ned Lamont and the board have published a report that provides policy recommendations for school districts to contemplate, suggesting the complete removal of cell phones from elementary and middle schools.</p>
    <p>In August 2024, the Washington Department of Education approved policies that encourage districts to limit cell phones in schools. The Oregon Department of Education, in October 2024, advised school districts to review their cell phone use policies to determine if they needed to be made stricter, Route Fifty reports.</p>
    <p>“It is important for schools to work purposefully to create conditions that promote deep thinking and sustained attention, free from the constant interruptions that cellphones and mobile devices can introduce,” ODE director Charlene Williams stated in a news release.</p>
    <p>Taft 7-12 Middle & High School, situated in Lincoln City, Oregon, is currently in its second year of prohibiting cell phones. Students are not allowed to bring them to school unless they are kept away in a magnetically-sealed pouch, which cost the district $20,000. Teachers report that students are more attentive and involved.</p>
    <p>“I’m not dealing with as much drama and their social media things,” remarked Sarah Horobin, a teacher at Taft High School. “I see that they’re actually talking to each other more … and that’s something they’ve had to learn again.”</p>
    <p>The Kansas State Board of Education voted in December 2024 to endorse the suggestions of an education task force that recommended districts forbid students from using cell phones during the day.</p>
    
    <h2>Gov. Tim Walz Requires Minnesota Schools to Implement Cell Phone Use Policies</h2>
    <p>Some other states have either mandated or are planning to mandate that schools establish policies to reduce cell phone use in the classroom.</p>
    <p>By March 15, 2025, Minnesota school districts and charter schools must have policies concerning cell phone use in place after Governor Tim Walz signed Senate File 3567 in May 2024. The policies are required to “minimize the impact of cell phones on student behavior, mental health, and academic attainment.”</p>
    <p>The legislation does not outline specific requirements.</p>

    <h2>3 States Enact Pilot/Grant Programs to Limit Cell Phone Usage in Schools</h2>
    <p>Last summer, three states revealed they were initiating pilot programs to limit cell phones in the classroom. In 2024, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Arkansas all approved funding to supply some districts with pouches for storing cell phones during class time.</p>
    <p>On July 1, 2024, Delaware Governor John Carney signed a $168 million supplemental spending bill which included $250,000 for a state Department of Education pilot program for cell phone pouches. In this pilot program, students would put their phones in locked pouches and would be unable to access them until the end of the school day. Lawmakers proposed that five to eight schools be selected to join the pilot. The state Department of Education has been tasked with executing the pilot and with collecting and analyzing the data.</p>
    <p>On July 2, 2024, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders also revealed a pilot grant program that will supply pouches for students to keep their cell phones in. She informed Fox News that 75% of the state's districts intend to participate in the initiative. A statewide ban was later implemented in February 2025.</p>
    <p>“Teen math, reading, and science scores have dropped in the United States and other developed nations since 2012, while school alienation has risen across the board,” she stated. “Arkansas’ phone-free schools’ program isn’t about taking anything away — it’s about giving kids the freedom to learn without distractions.</p>
    <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signed a bill on July 11 that designates $100 million for schools for a grant program to restrict cell phone use during the day. Schools are able to use these grants to buy pouches.</p>
    <p>Some districts are also independently deciding to launch pilot programs. In July, the DeKalb County School Board in Georgia unanimously sanctioned a pilot program that employs two distinct methods. One method requires students to turn off their phones and put them in a locked pouch that they keep with them throughout the school day. At the day's end, they would touch the pouch to a magnet to unlock it. This pouch method is being used at Salem, Henderson, Sequoyah, Lithonia, and Tucker middle schools, as well as Lakeside, Cross Keys, Lithonia, Tucker, and Martin Luther King, Jr. high schools.</p>
    <p>The second method involves cell phone lockers. This pilot program will be carried out at Miller Grove, Druid Hills, and Chapel Hill middle schools.</p>

    <h2>Colorado Attorney General Offers $50K to School Districts That Restrict Cell Phones</h2>
    <p>Colorado is adopting a distinctive strategy by offering $50,000 to school districts that create policies to limit cell phone use in classrooms. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser first revealed his office's intention to launch the new program back in September, on the same day he took part in a roundtable discussion with officials from Mesa County Valley School District 51. The Grand Junction-area district rolled out a new phone policy this school year.</p>
    <p>Under the new policy, students from kindergarten to 8th grade are forbidden from having personal devices at school during school hours. Students in grades 9-12 are not allowed to use devices during class time but can use them between classes and at lunch, though this is not encouraged.</p>
    <p>“I did not get a lot of pushback from families,” stated Superintendent Brian Hill. “I actually got more feedback from families saying, ‘Thank you for doing this.’ That doesn’t mean that there aren’t parents that were not happy with it.”</p>
    <p>Hill mentioned that parents can contact their students during the day by calling the school's main office line. He also contended that cell phones can be detrimental during an emergency.</p>
    <p>“Safety and security folks do not actually want your kiddo on a phone during those moments,” Hill said. “They want the kid paying attention to the adult so they’re safe. And (phones are) a way that you spread misinformation a lot of times.”</p>

    <h2>Several States Considering Cell Phone Bans, Restrictions</h2>
    <p>The number of states with cell phone bans, restrictions, or proposed laws is continuously increasing. In February, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker put forward statewide legislation that would prohibit cell phones during instructional periods.</p>
    <p>During his State of the State Address, Pritzker highlighted that Illinois eighth graders achieved the second-highest reading scores in the country in 2024 and the fifth-highest math scores, stating that "more focus on learning will bring even greater success across our state."</p>
    <p>“Improving the classroom environment and limiting distractions is vital to student achievement, and in conversations with educators and parents around this state, there is one thing that they commonly cite as an impediment to in the classroom: cell phones,” he declared. “Furthermore, cyberbullying has expanded at alarming rates and its time for Illinois to take measures to protect our kids. That’s why this session, I’ll move forward with legislation requiring all school districts in Illinois to adopt a cell phone policy that bans the use of phones during classroom instruction.”</p>
    <p>During a hearing on September 18, the Mississippi Senate Mental Health Task Force deliberated on restricting cell phones in schools.</p>
    <p>“Through our work in the Mental Health Task Force over the past two months, we have analyzed and looked at data from many sources. Those sources include books like The Anxious Generation and feedback from leaders in education and mental health. We have also looked at actions being considered and taken in other states,” stated State Senator David Parker (R), the task force chairman. “This is creating a crisis that is reflected in countless areas. I expect our task force to recommend that cellphone use be restricted during [key instruction and interactive time]. We continue to look at best practices to achieve this goal and hope to have a legislative method to help achieve this goal.”</p>
    <p>In September, Mississippi Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann (R) informed the Magnolia Tribune that extensive research indicates the deterioration in mental health among children and adolescents is partly linked to the almost continuous use of smartphones and social media.</p>
    <p>“Students should be concentrating on learning, not texting during classroom instruction. School safety and ensuring parents can stay connected with their children are also important concerns,” Hosemann commented. “We support legislation to allow local districts to determine how best to negotiate these concerns while still protecting classroom learning from distractions like smartphone use.”</p>
    <p>In January 2025, Wisconsin Republicans, who are in control of the Legislature, introduced legislation to ban cell phones and other electronic devices in K-12 classrooms, with exceptions for educational use or in an emergency, as reported by TMJ4.</p>
    <p>“We know it’s not going away, that this is not going to solve everything. Kids are still going to be getting on social media at night,” wrote Representative Joel Kitchens, the proposal's sponsor. “But we really need to teach them to use it responsibly. So hopefully they can learn when to put it aside and concentrate on what you’re doing.”</p>
    <p>Many schools throughout the state have rules in place that limit the use of smartphones and other devices in class, but Kitchens claims these policies have been mostly ineffective.</p>
    <p>“It’s very difficult to enforce and most of those schools do not enforce it very well,” Kitchens noted. “So really, we mean this to be support for those schools.”</p>
    <p>Since 2021, students at Saint Catherine's, a private Catholic school in Wisconsin, have been required to put their phones into magnetically locked pouches at the beginning of each day.</p>
    <p>“I think once we sent everyone home for COVID, part of that was like, ‘You have to be on the device. I have to see your face. You have to be on your screen,’” said Zach Prideaux, a theology teacher at Saint Catherine's. “So when all these kids come back, they’re locked in their phones all the time. Now they’re socializing, they’re engaging, they’re asking questions, they’re raising their hands. That’s what a school should look like.”</p>

    <h2>Cell Phone Bans in School: Supporters and Proponents Offer Strong Arguments</h2>
    <p>Unsurprisingly, all of these decisions have been greeted with varied opinions. For example, two LAUSD board members voted against the June motion, stating how challenging it would be for teachers and staff to enforce the ban. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that 77% of U.S. schools claim to forbid non-academic cell phone use at school. Nevertheless, as many educators can confirm, students either do not adhere to the bans or the bans are not enforced.</p>
    <p>As a part of LAUSD's enforcement measures, students will be given several warnings if they are found violating the rules. The initial step is a verbal reminder, which is then followed by a "referral to a counselor," and finally, communication with a parent or guardian.</p>
    <p>Many parents have also voiced criticism of the decision, stating their desire to be able to communicate with their children during school hours, especially given the current threat environment. In a recent survey by Prodigy, 63% of parent participants indicated their primary worry with school cell phone bans is the challenge of contacting their children during emergencies. The shooting at Apalachee High School on September 4, which resulted in the deaths of two teachers and two students, has sparked further discussion on this issue.</p>
    <p>“The fact of the matter is parents and families cannot rely on schools to effectively communicate with us in times of emergency, and this has happened time and again,” remarked Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, an education advocacy organization. “There’s a whole host of reasons why parents are deeply concerned about whether or not they’re going to get timely information about whether or not their kids are safe.”</p>
    <p>Supporters of school phone restrictions caution that permitting phone access during emergencies could place students in even greater jeopardy.</p>
    <p>“What’s even more important to me is their safety,” Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone-Free Schools Movement, explained to ABC News. “If my child was on the phone with me and they missed guidance from the teacher because they were distracted by their phone and they weren’t safe, that’s a worse scenario in my mind.”</p>

    <h2>Some Schools Make Exceptions to Cell Phone Bans</h2>
    <p>To handle various concerns, some states and individual districts have devised compromises or innovative solutions. In a last-minute change to California's Phones-Free Schools Act, lawmakers included some exceptions, such as schools not being able to forbid students from using phones in emergencies. The proposed legislation does not specify what qualifies as an emergency, leaving that determination to the schools.</p>
    <p>“We’re working under the assumption schools are going to be reasonable and responsive to legitimate parental concerns about being able to contact their kids in the aftermath of an emergency,” commented Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), a co-sponsor of the bill.</p>
    <p>Grand Island Senior High School in Nebraska implemented a new policy in January, which mandates that students keep their phones out of sight or in their bags and either silenced or turned off during school hours.</p>
    <p>“One of the essential questions that parents asked us was, ‘What if Sally or Johnny doesn’t have their phone if, God forbid, an active shooting happens or there is some sort of crisis in the building?’” then-principal Jeff Gilbertson said to ABC about the new rule. “We coach our kids to keep phones silenced. You don’t want to be talking on the phone when we’re in lockdown, because that would reveal your location to an active shooter.”</p>
    <p>Dr. Willough Jenkins, a pediatric psychiatrist at Rady Children’s Hospital and UC San Diego, mentioned to Fox News that lawmakers and schools should also account for students who might require a device for medical purposes.</p>
    <p>“There’s a certain population of children that are neurodivergent or with autism spectrum diagnoses, and they may be using devices to help with communication,” she noted, also mentioning that other students with medical issues, like diabetes, may need to check their blood glucose. “I think we have to consider all of these situations when we’re making rules.”</p>

    <h2>Cell Phone Bans Further Disadvantage the Disadvantaged</h2>
    <p>In numerous school districts nationwide, students are provided with 1:1 access to laptops in the classroom. Many of the programs on these devices enable students to learn at their own speed according to their skills and progress. This provides data that assists teachers in better grasping the individual strengths and weaknesses of each student. However, not all school districts are equipped equally.</p>
    <p>“One-to-one technology implementation frequently falls short, with small budgets, outdated devices, and limited home access holding many low-income students back,” writes Brandon Cardet-Hernandez, a former public school principal and senior education adviser to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. “For many kids, especially in districts that lack resources to provide alternative devices to students, the phone serves as a calculator, translator, mini-computer, and a door to information.”</p>

    <h2>Do Parents Support Cell Phone Bans in School?</h2>
    <p>Although some LAUSD parents expressed disapproval of the ban, the aforementioned Prodigy survey revealed that 64% of parents nationwide are in favor of prohibiting cell phones during the school day. A more recent survey, carried out by Pew Research from September 30 to October 6, 2024, showed that 68% of U.S. adults approve of a ban on middle and high school students using cell phones in class, with 45% strongly supporting it. An additional 24% are against it, while 8% stated they were undecided.</p>
    <p>The survey also indicated that the public is considerably less supportive of a full-day prohibition on cell phone use compared to a classroom ban. Approximately 36% are in favor of banning cell phones for the entire day, which includes lunch and the time between classes. In contrast, 53% are opposed to this stricter measure.</p>

    <h2>Do Teachers Support Cell Phone Bans in School?</h2>
    <p>The Prodigy survey also revealed that nearly three out of four teachers are in favor of a ban on cell phones, though 46% believe that setting screen time limits during the school day is a more effective strategy than an outright ban.</p>
    <p>On average, the teachers who were surveyed stated that they discipline students for using their cell phones five times per week, and 46% reported that they have confiscated students' phones. A large majority of teachers also concurred that a ban would enhance students' academic performance (81%), behavior and discipline (74%), and mental health (70%). A similar survey from Study.com discovered that teachers in schools with relaxed cell phone policies are 21% more likely to lose over an hour of learning time each week managing cell phone use.</p>
    <p>Last fall, 72% of U.S. high school teachers indicated that student distraction by their phones was a "major problem" in classrooms, as reported in a study by Pew Research Center. Additionally, about 33% of middle school teachers and 6% of elementary school teachers also identified cell phone distractions as a significant issue.</p>

    <p>Another Study.com survey, conducted between July 24 and August 6, found that in schools with stringent policies in place, 70% of educators noted safer learning environments, and 76% observed better student engagement (as shown in the graphic). Furthermore, 68% reported better classroom management.</p>
    <p>The survey also examined schools with moderate or flexible cell phone policies and discovered that educators in those schools were 21% more likely to forfeit more than an hour of instructional time each week to handle cell phone usage.</p>
    <p>“I’m always teaching to divided attention. There’s one eye on me, and one eye on the phone,” stated Brandie Provenzano, a high school English teacher in Prince William County, Virginia. “When we tell them to put it away, it’s not like they’re defiant. They do put them away. But then you see them leaning over, trying to look in their backpack and read their messages, or they have to go to the bathroom to go read their messages.”</p>

    <h2>Cell Phone Bans and School Safety</h2>
    <p>Study.com’s summer survey also questioned participants on how cell phone bans have affected the safety of students and teachers.</p>
    <p>Many teachers expressed the belief that cell phone bans could enhance student safety by reducing school bullying and other disruptive behaviors. However, the study once again showed clear differences in responses based on whether a school has a flexible or a strict cell phone policy.</p>
    <p>In schools with flexible policies, 57% of educators stated they think a ban would improve student safety. In contrast, 70% of educators in schools with strict policies believe that bans would enhance student safety.</p>
    <p>The survey revealed similar trends in the belief that bans enhance teacher safety. In schools with flexible policies, 54% of teachers think a cell phone ban would make them safer. In schools with strict policies, 69% believe a cell phone ban improves their safety.</p>

    <h2>LAUSD, San Mateo-Foster City Schools Report Cell Phone Ban Is Helping Student Achievement</h2>
    <p>One school within the LAUSD, East Los Angeles Renaissance Academy, had already started using pouches last year. However, they permit students to keep the locked pouches with them rather than handing over their phones to a central storage location.</p>
    <p>“Still having the phone on them helps to lower the anxiety,” explained Principal Francine Avila. “It’s a part of their body almost, and if you take it from them, you take the social-emotional component that goes with it.”</p>
    <p>Within a few weeks of starting to use the pouches, Avila noted that students were increasingly arriving to class on time and were more engaged in participation. The school staff also began to provide activities and sports during lunch to keep students occupied.</p>
    <p>In the spring of 2022, California’s San Mateo-Foster City School District acquired pouches for the storage of students' cell phones. Before introducing the pouches at the district's four middle schools, officials conducted meetings with parents to alleviate worries about not being able to reach their children. Parents and guardians now contact the school office when they need to communicate with their child.</p>
    <p>SMFCSD Superintendent Diego Ochoa informed NBC News that the pouches have been "an unquestioned success" and that students are concentrating more in class and interacting more with each other outside of class.</p>

    <h2>Student Mental Health and Cell Phones</h2>
    <p>While many mental health professionals advocate for a ban or restriction on cell phones, they also recommend that schools investigate other sources of distraction and other issues like bullying on social media.</p>
    <p>“Just because we removed the phone from the environment doesn’t mean these issues are going to go away,” Anthony Vaccaro, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Southern California, said to NBC.</p>
    <p>Jenkins mentioned that she observes many adverse effects of phone use among children and teenagers, but that the issue is "not black and white."</p>
    <p>“It’s quite a nuanced discussion because not all children struggle with phone use,” she commented. “But for those who do, we certainly are seeing the impacts in our mental health clinics and within psychiatry.”</p>
    <p>Regardless of whether state or district officials choose to implement laws or policies to restrict or prohibit student cell phone use, it is always advisable to involve students and parents in the decision-making. It is also important to acknowledge that a single policy change alone will not result in significant enhancements to student well-being.</p>
