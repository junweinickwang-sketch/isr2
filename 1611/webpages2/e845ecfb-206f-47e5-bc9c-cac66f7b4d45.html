Haidt has long lobbied for cell phone-free schools (as well as kids and teens using less technology in general), calling the smartphone “a tool of mass distraction.” Haidt’s book has been especially influential in the K–12 education field, resulting in town hall meetings across the country specifically to discuss this issue, and many educators have cited <em>The Anxious Generation</em> as a turning point in their thinking. <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-12">[12]</a><a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-13">[13]</a><a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-14">[14]</a><a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-15">[15]</a></p><!--[MOD6]--><span class="marker MOD6 mod-inline"></span><!--[PREMOD7]--><span class="marker PREMOD7 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">As of May 30, 2025, at least 23 U.S. states had some sort of cell phone restriction guidance in place.

A study found that “when iPhone users were unable to answer their ringing iPhone during a word search puzzle, heart rate and blood pressure increased, [and] self-reported feelings of anxiety and unpleasantness increased.” Hearing the unanswered phone especially spurs FOMO (fear of missing out) among youth. There is no need for kids and teens to experience such pressure and anxiety.

I use the term “screen value” to describe the level of benefit a kid gets from digital activities. When we ban phones, we are communicating to kids that <em>none</em> of the activities on their device have any real value. This is exactly the exact opposite message we should be sending. While meaningless, and certainly harmful, digital activities have no place at school, a phone ban takes away the opportunity to teach that there are valuable and enriching activities that can be done on those same devices. <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-46">[46]</a></p> </blockquote> <!--[PREMOD75]--><span class="marker PREMOD75 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">High school student Olivia Faith stated:</p><!--[MOD75]--><span class="marker MOD75 mod-inline"></span> <blockquote> <p>Last year when there was a call that a shooter was in the high school, parents, students and even school staff were terrified. I had my phone on me because I was having some health issues and had a pass for it. When the school went on lockdown, I texted my step dad who is a police officer, and he told me that multiple other schools got the same call, and it was not real. Although the situation was still very scary, I got outside information that helped calm me and the people around me. Without my phone, I would not have been able to get this information. If more students had their phones that day, everyone would’ve felt much safer.</p> <p>The main argument for why students are not allowed to have their phones in class is that students would be on them all the time and would not be able to learn because they would be too distracted. While this is a good point, it’s not necessarily true. If students knew they would have time on their phones later, most of them would not be on it during the time they were not allowed to be. Of course there would be students who would take advantage of being able to have their phones, but if they do a write up or detention at that point it would be reasonable. <a href="/procon/cell-phones-debate#pcref-2256292-55">[55]</a></p> </blockquote> </section><!--[H6]--><span class="marker h6"></span><section data-level="1" id="ref417570"> <h2 class="h1">U.S. state and territory policies on cell phone use in schools</h2> <!--[PREMOD78]--><span class="marker PREMOD78 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/US-Department-of-Education" class="md-crosslink " data-show-preview="true">U.S. Department of Education</a> has not implemented granular policies such as cell phone bans, but the department issued guidance for schools and districts to create policies in December 2024.
